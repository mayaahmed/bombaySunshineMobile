<h3> Chapter 34  </h3>
<h2>Outsmarting the dog van </h2>
       


<p> School went on as usual. Tara's classes started at eight in the
morning and after lunch break it continued till five in the
evening. The lessons were exhausting and confusing. Tara was sitting
in a math class and looked out of the window at the lush green
trees. The trees seemed to urge her to walk out of the room and romp
the meadows looking for surprises nature provided and also for
something that she could understand. </p>

<p> "You evaluate at these finite points and then check for convergence
of the method"  said the professor. </p>

<p> He was explaining to a completely lost set of students how Numerical
methods worked. It just did not make sense to Tara and to many other
students in the class.  The professor kept saying </p>

<p> "If you implement this method on a computer then you will see the
power of the method." </p>

<p> But everyone knew there was no time to implement the methods they were
learning on a computer. The power of the methods, if any, was not
something the students would see in the immediate future. Neither was
Tara in a mood to take the word of the professor about the power of
the methods. She considered the entire exercise a waste of time.  She
decided to go for a walk by the lakeside after tea. She waited
impatiently for the classes to get over for the day. </p>

<p> The  girls in  the hostel had  adopted a street  dog who
  they named  Cheeku. He had just  turned up one  day at the
  hostel from no where and he had become the hostel pet. But
  a lot of other girls did not like the puppy and complained
  about him a  lot. Instead of the dining  hall Tara had her
  tea  on the  lawns. When  Cheeku  came to  greet Tara  she
  shared poha (rice flakes) from her plate with the puppy. </p>

<p> "We must get the vet here soon and give him some shots" Meena said. </p>


<p> "A vet will be here next week" said Jyoti. "We have arranged for
that." </p>

<p> "Shots will not help" said Shashi frowning. "He is a public
menace. You girls should not be feeding this dog. He is a flea
basket. We must get rid of him." </p>

<p> Cheeku saw Shashi's frown.  Perhaps to get her in a good mood he
jumped on her. The plate of poha flew from Shashi's hand dropping poha
all over  the lawn. </p>

<p> "The devil" scolded Shashi. "Get away from me. Go away. Shoo. Shoo." </p>


<p> "Come here Cheeku" called Tara and Cheeku went and sat quietly next
to Tara. </p>

<p> "See, he is a pet" said Tara. </p>

<p> "Pet! He is a menace" said an angry Shashi. She left in a huff and Cheeku
ran after her to see where she was going. Tara and the girls sitting in the
lawn just laughed. </p>

<p> "Poor Cheeku. He simply does not understand why Shashi hates him. He is
trying to be nice" said Meena. </p>

<p> "I do not know how anyone can hate Cheeku. He has such a nice face" said Tara. </p>

<p> When the gardener saw the poha all over the lawn  he asked </p>

<p> "Who dropped  poha on the lawn? Who did this?" </p>

<p> "Shashi" shouted all the girls in unison and no one provided any further
explanation. </p>

<p> "One would think that such grown up girls will know how to eat without
dropping on the floor" said the gardener angrily. "I must speak to
the Garden secretary about teaching Shashi some table manners." </p>

<p> "Lawn manners is more appropriate" said Tara and waited to watch the fun.  </p>

<p> Sure enough the Garden secretary soon took Shashi to task.  Tara could
hear Shashi shouting "It is that dog. That devil of a dog. It is a
menace."  </p>

<p> Soon after Tara and Meena went and sat by the lake side and watched
the sunset. There were shades of orange, red, and yellow surrounding
the sun and the sound of the waves gently caressing the rocks was
very soothing.  </p>

<p> "This is so relaxing. My mind had been so disturbed lately" said Tara.  </p>

<p> "Why?" asked Meena.  </p>

<p> "I do not know. It is like I am not able to place my role in this
life. I feel like a visitor in my own life. It is weird and I cannot
explain this better.  I wish I could understand myself better" said
Tara with a sigh.  </p>

<p> The sun set and soon the shades of orange turned to Grey.  Tara walked
back to her hostel room and she played the tape recorder and a song from
Masoom grabbed her attention.  </p>

<p> "Tujse naraaz nahi zindagi, hairaan hu mein,
Tere masoom sawalon se pareshaan hu mein....
(I am not angry with you life but I am a little puzzled
and your innocent questions have disturbed me)."  </p>

<p> "This captures my feelings aptly at this moment" said Tara laughing. </p>

<p> "It was such a nice evening. One should never let sunsets go waste. It is
a gift to us from nature" said Meena. </p>

<p> "Yes. I wish one could make a living out of watching sunsets and studying
insects." </p>

<p> "You could do that if you became a naturalist" said Meena. </p>

<p> "That sounds like a good plan. Why did I not think of that before? Tara the
naturalist is what I will be then."  </p>

<p> As if by coincidence Mala just then had an insect problem. </p>

<p> "You can start with the insects in my room. There is a cockroach
in my room" said Mala. </p>

<p> "You are afraid of cockroaches? They are so tiny. What can they do to you?"
asked Tara. </p>

<p> "Do not give fundaes. Just get rid of it" said Mala. </p>

<p> So Tara went and chased the cockroach away from Mala's room. </p>

<p> "Nice job for a naturalist. Chasing cockroaches from the hostelites rooms"
said Tara shaking her head. </p>


<p> A few days later, as Tara was leaving for class in the morning, she
saw the Municipality's van for catching stray dogs. The van was parked
close to Tara's hostel. </p>

<p> "The dog catchers are here. We must save Cheeku" exclaimed Tara. </p>

<p> Tara and Meena ran back to the hostel and searched for Cheeku. Cheeku
was sleeping peacefully near the watchman's chair. </p>

<p> "Come Cheeku. Come along" said Tara. </p>

<p> Cheeku woke up and was going to jump and greet Tara when he somehow
 understood the urgency in Tara's voice and quietly followed Tara and
 Meena up the stairs to the Terrace. </p>

<p> "No one will ever think of looking for Cheeku here" said Tara smiling
tensely. </p>

<p> "The van has stopped close to our hostel. Someone must have squealed
on Cheeku" said Meena. </p>

<p> "It is a good thing no one saw us coming up here" said Tara. </p>

<p> The Municipality men were searching the hostel area for Cheeku. They
questioned the cooks and the watchman but they could not find Cheeku. </p>

<p> "Cheeku, you must remain quiet" said Tara and Cheeku obeyed. He made
no noise. </p>

<p> "Does instinct tell him there is danger?" asked Tara. </p>

<p> "May be. Look at all the poor dogs they have caught in the van. All
these dogs will die" said Meena. </p>

<p> "Their faces tell that they know they will die. It is a sad thing" said
Tara.  </p>

<p> And soon the men gave up the search and left. Tara and Meena gave a
sigh of relief. </p>

<p> When they got down the stairs Cheeku was a hero. </p>

<p> "Cheeku is safe. Cheers" shouted the girls who liked Cheeku.
Cheeku just jumped around happy to have all the attention. </p>

<p> "Well, I am glad the little devil is safe" said Shashi a little
grudgingly. </p>

<p> And Cheeku seemed happier than ever that Shashi was glad that he was
safe. He jumped and made Shashi drop her glass of water. </p>

<p> "I am almost tempted to call the van back for what this menace did
but I think I will let it be this time. Devil, get away from me.
Shoo, shoo" said Shashi and she gave him a little pat on his head. </p>

<p> "We are late for class" said Tara and they walked to class. </p>

<p> They saw the van again and the dogs in the caged back of the van. </p>

<p> "It is sad that these lovely animals must die" said Meena. </p>

<p> "It is necessary to do this. We do not like to have a house full of
cockroaches and hence we have to spray them to death.  Similarly we
cannot have a city full of stray dogs and hence they need to die"
explained Vimla. </p>

<p> "I wish there was a better alternative" said Meena.  </p>

<p> That afternoon when Tara got back to the hostel she was really
happy to see Cheeku. </p>

<p> "In all this mess, we are glad when the few people or things we
love are safe" said Tara smiling at Cheeku. </p>

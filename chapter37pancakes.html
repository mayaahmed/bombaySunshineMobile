<h3> Chapter 37  </h3>
<h2>Broadening horizons  </h2>


<p> Days passed quickly. Tara's view of Bombay changed drastically. A lot
of girls in the hostel were from far off places and they had a tourist
view of Bombay. It was fun to see Bombay from their perspective. </p>

<p> "Tomorrow there is a sale in Gujarat emporium. Are you going?" asked
Dina. </p>

<p> "Yes" said Tara. </p>

<p> "I never miss the annual sale at the Gujarat Emporium. The prices are
exorbitant usually. Only during this sale it becomes affordable" said
Dina. </p>


<p> Tara never shopped at the Gujarat emporium which was located far away
in town. She got everything she needed at Gandhi market. But Gandhi
market was a local market and it was not in the radar of
tourists. Since shopping was a social activity, Tara always went along
with her friends. </p>


<p> The next day Tara and a group of girls from the hostel went to town where
the emporium was and they did a lot of shopping.  </p>

<p> "I really like this fabric with the earthy colors and mirror work"
said Tara.  </p>

<p> "This emporium has a real good collection of clothes" said
Dina. "This emporium is the living proof of why India is famous for
its textile industry in history. " </p>
 
<p> Tara  certainly was not disappointed with  the shops her
friends were taking her  to. She was discovering some really
great places.  Luckily Tara knew  a thing or two  about good
tailors. Otherwise her life  spend in Bombay would have been
a  waste to  this little  crowd. Tara  took the  girls  to a
famous tailoring  shop. It  was a small  shed with  three or
four  machines.  The  girls  looked at  patterns  from  some
magazines and books and told  the tailor how they want their
clothes to be stitched. </p>

<p> "I can get these dresses ready in the second week of January" said the
 tailor. </p>

<p> "That is too far away. Can't you get it ready by Christmas?" asked Dina. </p>

<p> "Too much work at this time of the year" said the
tailor firmly. "It is not possible." </p>

<p> "That is too bad" said Dina disappointed. </p>

<p> "I can be like other tailors" said the tailor. "They will tell you
they will get the dresses ready in  two days and you have to go to them
a hundred times before they really get it ready. I like to deliver the
goods in time. January second week is the earliest I can get it
ready."  </p>

<p> "So be it then. We will pick up the dresses next year" said Tara. </p>

<p> "I am glad I have this ready made dress that I can wear for the Christmas
midnight mass" said Dina. </p>

<p> "This tailor does a good job. He has too many customers and so the
wait is longer. A small price to pay for quality" said Tara. </p>

<p> On the way back to the campus, Dina said </p>

<p> "Let us get down one stop before our bus stop. I want to spend some time
in the church." </p>

<p> So the girls got down at the church stop. They bought packets of
candles from a shop before going to church. The church was closed but
there were some statues outside the church and a candle tray at the
foot of these statues.  Tara and her friends lit their candles and
placed it on the tray. </p>

<p> "Make a wish and place the candle on the tray" whispered Dina. </p>

<p> "Today I can make twelve wishes and some of them might even come true"
said Tara with a grin since there were twelve candles in her packet of
candles. </p>

<p> "Twelve wishes are plenty" said Dina. </p>

<p> "I always think that twelve wishes are plenty and then I go one for
papa, one for mummy, and soon I am running short of candles to wish
on" said Tara. </p>

<p> After the church visit  Meena felt like visiting a temple.</p>

<p> "Let us go to a Temple. I feel very spiritual today" said Meena.</p>

<p>  And the girls walked to a temple which was situated near the lake.
 The birds had begin to gather on the trees for the night and the sun
 was setting. </p>

<p>  Tara went and rang the bells of the temple and made seven circles
 around the goddess. She took a small piece of coconut from the pooja
 tray and put red kumkum on her forehead. She looked around and saw
 her friends deep in prayer. So Tara went out and sat on the shores of
 the lake and watched the sunset. Soon her friends joined her. It was
 very quiet and peaceful. </p>

<p>  "I will teach you all how to meditate. Say Ohm with a deep breath seven
 times with your eyes closed. It is said that you will be soon on high"
 said Meena. </p>

<p>  Tara tried meditating with Meena but she soon gave up and said </p>

<p> "I think I will meditate with my eyes open. Nature is offering the most
 blessed sights to us at this moment."  </p>

<p>  "We can visit a church, a temple, or a mosque with the same piety"
 said Dina. "I wonder why there are riots and killings in the name of
 religion then?" </p>

 <p> "It is because we were brought up in Bombay that we have this respect
 for all religions and culture" said Meena. "Our parents who are not
 originally from Bombay do not visit any religious place except of
 their own faith." </p>

<p> "That is true. I am glad I am from Bombay. I am glad that we are truly
 secular" said Tara. </p>

<p> "The true road to spirituality is secular" declared Meena.</p>

<p> When Tara got back to her room she looked at all the things she
purchased again. A metal bangle, a cloth wrapped folder, an ethnic
toy, and a hair band were among her purchases of the day. A few other
girls were in her room too looking in greater detail at what every one
had purchased. Suddenly they heard people singing loudly from a
distance. </p>

<p> "What is that sound?  Who are they?" asked Bindu. </p>

<p> "That is the Christmas carol" said Tara. "People from the church
sing songs and visit houses. There is also somebody dressed like a
Santa Claus who will distribute sweets to children. Haven't you ever
seen a Christmas carol before?" </p>

<p> "We do not have that concept in Hyderabad where I live though I have
read about Christmas carols in books" said Bindu. </p>

<p> "Well now you can see a Bombay Christmas carol. They are heading straight
for our hostel" said Tara. </p>

<p> The carol visited Dina's room. Dina was a regular church goer and so
she had invited the Christmas carol to the hostel. The group of people
sang many songs and in the end sang </p>

<p> "We wish you a merry Christmas, merry Christmas,
and a happy happy new year." </p>

<p> "That was fun" said Bindu after the group of people left.  </p>

<p> Tara went home for Christmas vacations. Unlike olden days when she
went to a class to learn cooking, she had taken to experimenting
recipes published in magazines. When Seeta came for a visit she saw
Tara surrounded with magazines and books. Tara got up from
the couch and handed a magazine to Seeta and said </p>

<p> "Look at this magazine. It is called Woman's Journal. Here is another
and it is called Woman's companion. Here is another called Home
improvement and the list goes on. These magazines for women are all
about cooking, cleaning, and making a husband happy. The theme of
these books are marriage is important and you must do all you can to
make a marriage happy. It says when your husband comes home tired,
greet him with a smile and make him feel comfortable. On the other
hand here are the magazines for men and they talk nothing about making
a wife happy or even a girlfriend happy. It talks more about how you
can get a girlfriend and tricks to acquire a date but nothing about
tricks to make them stay happy." </p>

<p> "Men are men and women are women. Our roles are different" said Seeta. </p>

<p> "Marriage involves two people but for some reason, society places the
burden of making a marriage happy on the woman. Moreover the picture
of a good wife painted is that of a well read servant. I am not at all
impressed." </p>

<p> "You read about skills you usually do not have. It is hard for a man
to attract attention but easy to keep the attention once gained from a
woman.  It is easy for a woman to get attention but hard for her to
retain the attention.  Get it?"  </p>

<p> "May be you have a point there. Let us forget the literature value of
these magazines. The recipes given here are good.  Today I am going to make
this pastry in the shape of a butterfly." </p>

<p> The girls then went in to the kitchen. </p>

<p> "What are you two doing?" asked Tara's mother. </p>

<p> "We are making butterfly pancakes" said Tara. </p>

<p> "What is a butterfly pancake?" asked Tara's little brother. </p>

<p> "You will see soon" said Tara. </p>

<p> They fried bread and arranged it in the shape of a butterfly. The next
step was to put icing on it.</p>

<p> "This recipe says we need to use raw 
eggs for the icing" said Tara. "Yuck! Can we avoid that?" </p>

<p> "Let us stick to the recipe" said Seeta.</p>

<p> So Tara and Seeta made some icing and spread it on the bread. They gave
everyone a pancake to eat. </p>

<p> "It is nice" said Tara's mother. </p>

<p> "Not bad" said Tara's brother. </p>

<p> "Interesting" said Tara's father. </p>

<p> And finally it was Tara's turn to eat the pancake. She could not
forget the raw eggs and she was hesitant to eat the pancakes. She
decided to be generous and said </p>

<p> "Please feel free to have some more. There is more." </p>

<p> "No. No. You eat. You took so much trouble to make this" said Tara's
mother. </p>

<p> "Okay" said Tara  and took a bite only to run and puke it out.</p>

<p> When Tara came back to the room she found everyone roaring with laughter. </p>

<p> "I have heard of people vomiting after eating  someone else's cooking but
this is the first time I have seen a person vomit after eating her own
cooking" said Tara's brother. </p>

<p> "Hooo, hooo, hooo, this is unbelievable" laughed Tara's mother. </p>

<p> Tara looked at the remaining butterfly pancakes and said </p>

<p> "No way I am eating that. It has raw eggs in it." </p>

<p> The crowd in the room went "Hoo, hooo, hooo, hee hee hee."  </p>

<p> "I am going for a walk. I am sick of people laughing at me. Come
Seeta " said Tara and the two girls left the room. </p>

<p> "So how are things with you Tara? You are finishing your masters soon.
What next?" asked Seeta. </p>

<p> "I do not know" said Tara. "There are so may choices. But I cannot
tell what exactly I must do. I envy people who know their minds." </p>

<p> Tara recited </p>

<p> "Someday my thoughts will be free and flowing, <br/>

 Someday I will be sure of what I am saying, <br/>

 I will be on my own, <br/>

 and will act fully grown, <br/>

 there will be no doubts, <br/>

 nor confusing shouts, <br/>

 Someday I will know my mind, <br/>

 Someday my true path I will find." </p>

<p> "Our role in this life is never clear till we die. That is what makes
 life such a surprise. The twists and turns will always remain
 unknown" said Seeta. </p>

<p> "So we live for the moment then?" asked Tara. </p>

<p> "Yes, and some of these moments are so wonderful" said Seeta. </p>

<p> "Some of these moments will live forever, <br/>

when my heart missed a beat, <br/>

and I was in love, <br/>

the time stood still, <br/>

and the world suddenly uncertain, <br/>

Some of these moments will live forever. <br/>

when I go back in time, <br/>

these moments stand out, <br/>

yes there are others, <br/>

but these will always be, <br/>

the first to come to my mind, <br/>

for some of these moments will live forever."  </p>


<p> "Now these are the moments of yours I know nothing of yet?" asked Tara. </p>

<p> "Some moments are best when they are secret" said Seeta. </p>

<p> "Well, then so be it.  It is our policy to never mess up other people's fun.
Gee, but that butterfly pancakes were a horror weren't they?" asked Tara. </p>

<p> "Not that bad. I ate it" said Seeta. </p>

<p> "Yuck. That is among the moments I will soon forget" said Tara making
a wry face. </p>

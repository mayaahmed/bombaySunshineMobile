<h3> Chapter 21  </h3>
<h2> Songs that touch the heart </h2>


<p> Tara was crying over a sad song she heard on the radio. When her mother saw 
this she asked </p>

<p> "You will have to face tougher things in life than sad songs. What
will you do then?" </p>

<p> "I do not know" said Tara. "I only hope I die before life gets too
sad for me." </p>

<p> "Life will always be nice to you" said Tara's mother giving Tara a hug. </p>

<p> "If you say that mother, I know it will be true" said Tara smiling
through her tears. </p>

<p> Just then Seeta came in. Tara hurriedly wiped her tears. </p>

<p> "This girl is crying listening to a song" said Tara's mother. </p>

<p> "Don't embarrass me" said Tara. </p>

<p> "Nothing to be embarrassed about" said Seeta. "Sad movies and songs
make me sad too. I do not know why people have to feel sad."  </p>

<p> "Life is a rainbow of emotions. One has to feel every feeling
to enjoy the glory of life" said Tara's mother. </p>

<p> Just then they heard noise from the drums of a street circus. Everyone
ran to the balcony to watch. The street circus performers set up their
equipment. They had a few acts. They had a pair of monkeys. They
dressed one as a man and the other as a woman. The monkey playing the
female role looked at a mirror all the time. The male would come and
offer her something. The female monkey would ignore the gift and the
male would go away and bring something else. Both the animals were
tied to the end of sticks and prompted by the owner to do their parts. </p>

<p> "It is kind of cute" said Seeta. </p>

<p> "It is funny" agreed Tara. </p>

<p> After the monkey act, they made a woman walk a rope. </p>

<p> "This act is really dangerous" said Tara. "There are no safety nets
below. If the woman falls down she will be injured badly. All this is for
such trivial earnings!" </p>

<p> "Poor lady" said Seeta. "Look at the things people do to earn a
living." </p>

<p> After that they made a dog jump through a burning tire. Then they tied
a child to a ten feet pole with a cloth and raised it high. A man
held the stick on his chin and did other tricks. The child was a
little girl who was completely indifferent to where she was and
she was concentrating on a little toy she held in her hand. After that
a little boy came dressed like a hen in colorful clothes and he
danced around. </p>

<p> "I do not know why I like this act" said Tara. "It might be the
color or the cheerfulness. This is the best part of a street circus."  </p>

<p> Then a man came and slashed himself with a thick rope. </p>

<p>  "Does he get hurt?" asked Tara wincing.  </p>

<p> "No. I think it is a trick" said Seeta. </p>

<p>  Finally, the street performers opened a box and there was a statue of a
god in it. They then walked around asking for money holding  steel
plates in their hands. Tara threw a couple of coins from the balcony. </p>


<p> "These people have hard lives" said Tara. "I am ashamed I cried
because I thought I would lose something after listening to a
song. These people risk their very lives each day." </p>

<p> "Every living thing has its purpose" said Tara's mother. "Maybe the
way you are  is for a purpose."  </p>

<p> "I only hope it is for a good purpose" said Tara and everyone laughed. </p>

<p> Mani came running and said </p>

<p> "Bewada Mama (drunkard uncle) is having a fight with Mami again." </p>

<p> Bewada Mama was a chronic alcoholic. When he was not drunk he was a
perfect gentleman. Even when he was stone drunk he was respectful
towards women. He belonged to a community of Maharashtrians who
respected women traditionally. But he invariably got in to fights with
his wife when he was drunk. </p>

<p> Tara and Seeta decided to go and diffuse the situation.
When they got to Bewada Mama's house, Mama was sitting on the floor
of the veranda near the stairs and saying </p>

<p> "One day I will leave this house and go. This woman has no control on
her tongue. She takes me for granted. Soon she is going to be
surprised." </p>

<p> "Mama, are you fighting with Mami again?" asked Tara. "Why do you
drink so much?  If you did not drink then Mami would not fight with
you." </p>

<p> "She will fight because she likes to fight. My drinking is just
an excuse."  </p>

<p> "Oh yes, I fight for no reason ha?" asked Mami.  "This man spend his
whole month's salary on buying drinks. What will I do now? My salary
is not enough to run this house." </p>

<p> "Mama why did you do that? Why did you waste your salary away like that?"
asked Tara. </p>

<p> Mama did not reply and sat with his head bend down. </p>

<p> "Talk some sense into that man" said Mami  crying. </p>

<p> Mama looked at Mami and said </p>

<p> "I will stop drinking. I promise. Please do not cry." </p> 

<p> "You will stop drinking when you die" said Mami. </p>

<p> "Look at this woman. Look at how she talks. Is this woman
an Indian woman? Indian women pray to god that they die
suhagan (not widowed). This woman is talking about my death." </p>

<p> "I want to die suhagan too, that is why I am asking you to
stop drinking like this. Now come and have lunch."  </p>

<p> "I do not want any lunch" said Mama sulking. </p>

<p> "Come and eat lunch. How can I eat if you have not eaten?  I am
hungry." </p>

<p> "You can eat alright. You have no feelings either."  </p>

<p> When Mama and Mami both started to sulk the girls tried to make
peace between them. </p>

<p> "Mama, you must try to stop drinking" said Tara. "Then there will be
no such fights." </p>

<p> "Yes, you must eat the nice meal Mami cooked for you" said
Seeta. </p>
 
<p> Mama got up slowly and went and sat at the table for eating
lunch. Mami served him chapatis and fish curry. Mami also served the
girls some food.  The food was very spicy and their eyes
watered. Coastal Maharashtrian cooking was delicious and spicy. </p>

<p> "Very hot for you girls?" asked Mami. </p>

<p> "Yes, but it is good. Maza agaya (it was fun)" said Tara. </p>

<p> "Do you want some more rotis?" Mami asked Mama. </p>

<p> "Yes" said Mama and he was eating happily. </p>

<p> "Paisa pheko, tamasha dekho, Mama aur Mami ka pyaar dekho, ..." sang
Tara and Seeta. </p>

<p> The song meant throw money and see a drama of Mama and Mami's love.
This was a popular Hindi movie song modified for the sake of Mama and
Mami by the girls. </p>

<p> "What love at this age?" said Mami blushing. </p>

<p> After Mama finished eating, Mami sat down to eat. The traditional
Indian wife ate only after the husband ate no matter whether he was a
chronic drunkard.  Tara looked at Mami who must have been a beauty in
her days. She wore a traditional sari with a big bindi on her
forehead. Her hands were full of glass bangles. She wore a mangalsutra
on her neck and a nose ring on her nose.  This was a nice wife even if
she had a sharp tongue. </p>

<p> When Tara and Seeta left the house Tara said </p>

<p> "This couple would have been really happy together if Mama
did not drink so much. For some reason people do not like
mild happiness and they do things to make sure misery play
a major role in their life. Then they spend their energies
to fight that misery and survive. That gives them a reason
to exist I think."  </p>

<p> When Tara got back home she saw Seema Akka talking to her mother. When
she saw Tara she said  </p>

<p> "You must not talk to drunkards. They are not in their senses
and can do anything." </p>

<p> "I am not scared of Mama" said Tara. </p>

<p> "This girl does exactly what she wants" said Seema Akka. "Not such a
nice trend in women. She will suffer for it when she leaves her
father's home. A girl who is too happy in her father's house always
suffers in the in laws house."  </p>

<p> "Is that true mother?" asked Tara.  </p>

<p> "They say like that" said Tara's mother. "There is a little truth to
it because people outside are not going to be like people at home and
you will need to adjust. But my daughter will do just fine."   </p>

<p> "Do not spoil her. Teach her to cook.  She does not know how to
cook. She is so grown up now.  Teach her to be responsible" continued
Seema Akka.  </p>

<p> "She will learn when her time comes. Let her be a child for
some more time" said Tara's mother running her fingers
through Tara's long hair. Tara stuck her tongue out at
Seema Akka and everyone laughed.  </p>

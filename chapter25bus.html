<h3> Chapter 25  </h3>
<h2>Home Science</h2>

<p> It was vacation time again. Tara enrolled for some art and cooking
classes taught by a lady called Chandana at her home in Dadar.
Chandana taught tailoring, painting, flower arrangement, cake making,
cooking, and many other courses. The middle class parents of Bombay
liked to show off the things their daughters made to everyone who
visited them. Their daughters were being trained to become ideal
wives. </p>

<p> To get to Dadar, Tara and her friends had to travel by bus. They
always went to the upper deck of the double decker bus to sit. The bus
moved as soon as the last passenger got in so climbing to the top deck
had to be done carefully holding both the side railings.  Seema was
always afraid she would fall out of the bus. </p>


<p> "I hope the bus would stop a wee bit longer so that I could make this
stairs to the upper deck safely" said Seema. </p>

<p> "Hey, do not fall on me" said Mala. "I am right behind you."  </p>

<p> "Go ahead of me" said Seema. "At least that way I can fall out of
the bus in peace."  </p>

<p>  Mala went quickly ahead of Seema on the narrow stairs. </p>

<p> "Can my kids go ahead too?" pleaded a lady behind Seema. </p>

<p> "Be my guest, go ahead" said Seema. </p>

<p> The lady and her two kids went ahead of Seema quickly. </p>

<p> "Do you want to go ahead too?" asked  an angry Seema to a young man behind
her on the stairs. </p>

<p> "No" said the young man. "Have no fear. I will save you if you fall." </p>

<p> "Ha!" said Seema in reply. </p>

<p> Tara and her friends found seats to sit right in the front of the
bus.  There was a big glass window in front of them. </p>

<p> "Now we all have window seats" said Seeta. </p>

<p> The bus Conductor went around shouting:
"Ticket. Ticket."  </p>

<p> "Give us four tickets to Dadar station" said Seeta offering a ten
rupee note. </p>

<p> "Give exact change" said the Conductor rudely. "I have no chutta
(change)."  </p>

<p> Seeta looked in her purse and hurriedly produced the exact change
required for the tickets. </p>

<p> The Conductor moved on calling out "Ticket. Ticket. Ticket." </p>

<p> It so happened that the chivalrous young man Seema met on the stairs
did not have exact change for his ticket. He produced a five rupee
note instead of the one rupee seventy five paise he needed for a
ticket. </p>

<p> "Get out of this bus" scolded the conductor. </p>

<p> "I do not have change...." the young man tried to explain. </p>

<p> "What do you think? I have a machine to produce change? Does chutta
grow on trees? Why do you get into the bus without exact chutta? Get out."  </p>

<p> The conductor rang the bell of the bus and the bus stopped. </p>

<p> "Get out" the conductor said to the young man.  </p>


<p> Now this was a decent young man and he was visiting Bombay for the
first time. He was almost in tears and he said </p>

<p> "Is this the way to behave? I do not want any change back. Just give
me the ticket please.  How can you throw me out of the bus like this?" </p>

<p> The conductor was now completely satisfied that he showed the young
man who the boss was. He rang the bell again and the bus began to
move. </p>

<p> "This time I will give you change back" said the conductor. "But
from now on you must carry exact change every time you travel in a
bus." </p>

<p> The conductor gave the young man his ticket and change before
he moved on calling out "Ticket, ticket, ticket." </p>

<p> "These conductors are so rude" said Tara. </p>

<p> "We should complain about him" said Seeta. "I am going to write
down his identity number."  </p>

<p> Seeta then went and looked at the badge of the conductor and wrote
down the identity number of the conductor.  </p>

<p> "She is writing down my number! Ha, ha, ha" laughed
the Conductor. </p>

<p> "Stand straight. Let me write down your identity number" said Seeta
with a scolding glance. </p>

<p> "Somebody should do something" said an old man. "Good beti. You must
complain."  </p>

<p> "These conductors have no  manners" said another lady. </p>

<p> The conductor sensing the mood of the public decided wisely to keep
his mouth shut. Bombay public if enraged could be quite wild. He was
also quite satisfied for the day with the complete victory he had over
the young man just then. So he kept a low profile and
moved around giving out  tickets saying </p>

<p> "Ticket. Ticket. Ticket." </p>

<p> "No one can do anything to these conductors" said Seema. "It is a
government job and it is permanent. I do not see how your complaining
is going to help at all." </p>

<p> "At least I showed my disapproval of his behavior" said Seeta with a grin. </p>

<p> "Thank you" said the young man. </p>

<p> "Have no fear. We will save you from the conductor if he cares to
bother you again" said Seema laughing. </p>

<p>The young man smiled sheepishly in reply. The bus got really crowded
as time went by. Way before their bus stop arrived the girls worked
their way through the crowd and inched their way slowly to the
door. To avoid the crowd that would rush in when the bus stopped, as
soon as the bus slowed down before the stop, the girls stepped down
from the bus. They then ran along with the bus for a short while to
avoid falling. Many others got out of the bus in a similar
fashion. Most seasoned bus travelers of Bombay knew this trick to get
out of the bus before it stopped completely. </p>

<p> The Dadar bus stop was unusable as a bus stop. Many canvas huts had
propped up at the bus stop and people waiting for a bus had to wait on
the road.  Children were playing outside these huts. Some women were
cooking on firewood. Others were cleaning the inside of their huts
with brooms. The huts were really tiny and people lived practically on
the roads. </p>

<p> "It is sad that these honest and hard working people cannot afford a
decent living" said Tara. "I could understand their plight if these
people were drug addicts, drunkards, or lazy.  This shakes my
fundamental belief that one can make life better by working hard." </p>

<p> "They should stay on in their villages instead of coming to Bombay"
said Seema.  "Everyone can afford better houses in villages."  </p>

<p> "They will starve if they stayed on in their villages even though they
may live in better houses" said Tara. </p>

<p> "Life is about natural choices. This life must be better else they would
not be here" said Seeta. </p>

<p> "I think the problem with India is that we are not developing the
villages" said Mala. "Bombay is a small city and it cannot handle so
many people. These people should stay on in their villages and develop
the villages." </p>

<p> "I agree to that" said Tara. "Leaders like Gandhi used to live in
villages and work from there. Nowadays all the politicians live in big
cities and they seem to be far removed from the rural scene." </p>

<p> "Who likes to live in villages anyways? Will you live in a village?"
asked Seema. </p>

<p> "Why not?" asked Tara.  "I can live in a village alright but do not
ask me to be a politician. Please." </p>

<p> Everyone  laughed. </p>

<p> "In  time everything will get better" said Seeta. </p>

<p> "Cheers to that thought" said Tara. She recited a poem she wrote: </p>

<p> "Title: The song of miserable lives <br/>

Oh, this weary road, <br/>

with misery as my load, <br/>

Nothing cheerful in sight, <br/>

I try to move with all my might. <br/>

Will it be better tomorrow? <br/>

or just another day of sorrow? <br/>

Sometimes I feel like giving it all up, <br/>

then there is always this thing called hope, <br/>

which prompts me to continue to hold, <br/>

as I walk this weary road." </p>


<p> "It will definitely be better. We  are a bunch of optimists" said
Seeta. </p>

<p> Dadar market was very big. There was a street under the bridge where
far and wide you could see only flower sellers. The girls bought
garlands of flowers for their hair. </p>

<p> "I like my jasmine garlands mixed with aboli flowers" said Seeta. </p>

<p> "The splash of orange on white looks nice. I wonder what aboli means?"
asked Tara. </p>

<p> "Aboli is the name of this shade of orange" explained Seeta. </p>

<p> "Aboli somehow I thought  meant unable to speak" said Tara. </p>

<p> "No. It is just a shade of orange" asserted Seeta. </p>


<p> The girls also had to go through a huge vegetable market to get to
their home science class. There were sellers everywhere. Piles of raw
mangoes, lemons, capsicums, tomatoes, green chillies, and other
vegetables were seen everywhere. This was a wholesale market. Women
bought vegetables in bulk and they bargained. The sellers weighed out
vegetables in kilos and filled the cloth bags the women carried. Tara
loved this walk through the market though there was a smell of rotting
vegetables all around. The girls took their time reaching their class
looking around at the intense activity of the market or watching cows
eating discarded cabbage leaves on the floor. </p>

<p> When the girls finally reached class Chandana said  </p>

<p> "Tara, today we can do your basket arrangement. It seems like
you have made enough velvet roses and rajnigandhas. We need to make
some more leaves but we are quite ready for the arrangement."   </p>

<p> Tara began to cut fabric using a cardboard pattern to make leaves.
Seeta worked on her fabric painting, Mala worked on a sewing machine,
and Seema did embroidery. There were many other girls there too at the
same time working on some craft of their choice.  </p>

<p> "Did you girls know Manju is engaged?" asked Chandana.  </p>

<p> "No. When are you getting married?" asked Seeta.  </p>

<p> "In six months time" said Manju. "My fiance is coming home for
dinner."   </p>

<p> "Manju is baking a walnut cake for her fiance" said Chandana. "Her
fiance is going to be impressed."  </p>

<p> Chandana brought out the walnut cake from the oven.  </p>

<p> "It looks good" said Manju. "I think I will get ready to go home now."  </p>

<p> Manju came out wearing a silk sari. She had made up her face and
worked on her hair.  She was completely a transformed person.  </p>

<p> "By the time I get home, my fiance will be there" she explained. "I
would not want him to see me in a boring salwar kurta."  </p>

<p> When Manju left Tara said  </p>

<p> "I do not understand. After marriage she cannot all the time be
wearing silk saris. It is so uncomfortable. All this looks like a
little bit of cheating."  </p>

<p> "First impressions are everything" said Chandana. "That is why in
arranged marriages people spend so much time dressing up the bride.
Once the bridegroom sees the bride as pretty the impression stays on
for a long time and most of the times forever."  </p>

<p> "Yes, in fact new brides stay dressed up pretty with all the jewelry
for a long time even after the wedding" said Seeta.  </p>

<p> "So girls, forget what the modern world says" said Chandana. "Dress
up in your best when your man comes seeking a bride."  </p>

<p> Tara finished arranging her flower basket. She held it up and said "My
basket looks nice. My mother will be happy to see my flower basket."  </p>

<p> On the way back home Seeta said "Manju looks so happy engaged. She
also looks so pretty. It must be fun being engaged."   </p>

<p> "I do not think getting married is fun" said Tara. "All that cooking
and cleaning does not impress me as a lifestyle. I will postponed it
as much as I can. I know I can stay single till twenty three before
the society pressures get to me and my family.  I will stay single
till twenty three. No thoughts of marrying or engagements for me till
then. I want to have a career."  </p>

<p> "Tara, the way you are I can bet you will be the first to get married"
said Seeta. </p>

<p> "No way" said Tara.</p>

<p> "What if you fall in love?" asked Seeta teasingly.</p>

<p> Tara replied: </p>

<p> "Let the bells ring, <br/>

 and the love birds sing, <br/>

 A nice tune they may carry <br/>

 but hey, I will not marry." </p>

<p> "You will not marry" agreed Seeta. "Our bus is here. To our
 homes, us this bus will carry." </p>

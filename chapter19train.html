<h3> Chapter 19  </h3>
<h2> Bombay local trains </h2>

<p> Tara was beginning her first day at college. Tara had never traveled
alone in a train before. Her mother dropped her at the train station. </p>

<p> "Are you sure you will manage alright?" asked Tara's mother.  "Do
you want me to come with you?" </p>

<p> "I will manage just fine" said Tara. </p>

<p> "Remember your train will come on platform one. You need to look for
the VT train. Check with someone before you enter the train. If you
get into the wrong train you will miss your class." </p>

<p> Tara's mother could not enter the station without a platform
ticket. She was hesitant to leave Tara.  Tara did not like the fuss
but she could read concern on her mother's face. She reassured her
mother that she can manage alright.  So her mother left her and
disappeared down the road. </p>

<p> There were a lot of platforms. But finding platform one was not
difficult because of the sign boards. There were a lot of people
waiting on that platform. It was eight in the morning and it was rush
hour. Tara walked along the platform and she saw a place where
there were a lot of women standing. She asked one lady </p>

<p> "Is this where the second class ladies compartment is going to come?" </p>

<p> "Yes" said the lady. </p>

<p> Tara could see that a lot of people on the platform already knew each
other. These women took the same train each day to work. Also there
were women carrying baskets of vegetables and there were a couple of
young girls with boxes containing earrings, bangles, bindis, and other
such items. Tara knew that they would sell these things on the
train. She had seen all this on her previous train trips with her
family. She also had seen beggars on the train who would sing songs
and ask for money. Also she had seen eunuchs who would ask for money
just because they were eunuchs. But what she had not seen was yet to
come. </p>

<p> Tara had never taken a train in the rush hour before. As soon as the
train stopped Tara was carried by this crowd of women into the train.
She felt that she was sort of pushed into the train. When the train
moved on she stood amongst a sea of women. She could hardly
breathe. The compartment was packed with women. Tara could not move
her hands. She attempted to adjust her bag on her shoulder but she
gave up. </p>

<p> But at Dadar station things got a little better. A lot of women got
down and the sellers started moving around in the train. It was still
packed but it was a little better. Tara even found a place to sit. But
that was just plain luck. A lady sitting close to where Tara was
standing got down at Dadar. She offered her vacant seat to Tara before
she left. </p>

<p> At Byculla station Tara saw a group of fish sellers getting into the
train.  These fish sellers were treated like royalty. No matter how
crowded the train was, everyone made space for them. The reason they
were treated like royalty was simple. They carried baskets full of
fish on their heads. The fish was placed on ice and the water from
melting ice dripped all around them. No one wanted this water dripping
on them, otherwise they would stink all day. </p>

<p> But that day one vegetable seller was busy going through the
vegetables in her basket and she did not see these fisher women enter
the train. As luck would have it, a few drops of water fell from a
fisher woman's basket on the vegetable seller. The fisher woman was a
tall and tough woman and this vegetable seller was a very small woman
but she was brave. She got up from the floor of the train compartment
where she was sitting next to her vegetable basket, and she used so
many swear words in two minutes that Tara had not heard in all her
life.  </p>

<p> "How dare you drop water on me?" the vegetable seller shouted angrily.
"You ****. You ****. You *****. You ***."  </p>

<p> The fisher woman tried to ignore the vegetable seller and she even laughed
a little. But the vegetable seller continued.   </p>

<p> "You *****, you *****, you *****, ...."  </p>

<p> After some time the fisher woman got angry and she purposely dropped
some more water on the vegetable seller. This was too much for the
vegetable seller and she pulled the fisher woman's hair. The
fisher woman pulled the hair of the vegetable seller back in return.
At this the vegetable seller tried to push the basket of fish from the
fisher woman's head. The fisher woman held her basket firmly with one
hand and pulled the vegetable seller's hair with all her might with
her other hand. All this lead to a lot of yelling and screaming.  </p>

<p> Tara was a little frightened and she covered her face.  </p>

<p> "New to local trains?" A lady sitting next to Tara asked.  </p>

<p> "Yes" said Tara.  </p>

<p> "Everyday it is like this. I do not understand why these sellers cannot
behave. They should be banned from taking trains."   </p>

<p> "But they also have to commute" said another lady.  </p>

<p>  "Yes, but not during rush hour" said the first lady. "Or they should
have separate compartments for these sellers."  </p>

<p>  "We all want a lot of things" said the other lady smiling. </p>


<p>  The din stopped when the fisher woman got down at the next station. The
vegetable seller sat down with tears in her eyes. Her hair was pulled
badly and it was hurting. When VT station finally arrived Tara was
happy to get out of the train. Tara saw Rekha getting out of another
compartment of the train. </p>

<p>  "You took the eight thirty train?" asked Rekha. </p>

<p>  "Yes. Were you in this train too? How come I did not see you?" asked Tara. </p>

<p>  "I was in the first class compartment" said Rekha. </p>

<p>  "Oh, that is why I did not see you" said Tara. "Boy! Did I learn so
much on this trip." </p>

<p> "What do you mean?" asked Rekha. </p>

<p>  "I learned a lot of bad words.  A fisher woman and a vegetable seller was
fighting their heads off, no more like their hairs off. They pulled at each
others hair quite a bit. Do you want me to tell you some of the bad words
that I learned today?" </p>

<p>  "No, no, no, no"  said Rekha laughing. "You should buy a first class
pass.  It is much better in the first class compartment." </p>

<p>  "But it costs thrice as much." </p>

<p> "Yes, but as a student you get fifty percent off and it becomes affordable.
Of course the other women hate us for that concession, but it works for us
fine." </p>

<p> "That sounds like a good plan. Let us see. Boy! Have you noticed how
women fight?  They shout and scream and tear. They do not hit so much
like men. When men fight it is a lot of kicks and punches but when
women fight it is a lot of shouting. What a way to begin a day?!" </p>

<p> Tara was still in a bit of shock. </p>

<p> "If you decide to travel first class, take the eight thirty
train. Then we can take this trip together and it will be fun." </p>

<p> "Yes, I will do that. Of course the second class maybe more educational
though."  </p>

<p>  "What do you mean?"  </p>

<p>  "I learned a lot of new words today. For example, I never heard  the word
**** before." </p>

<p> "Stop it, Tara" said Rekha laughing. </p>

<p> They walked to college together from the station. Tara bought a
first class pass for the month the next day. She met Rekha in the
first class compartment for women. </p>

<p> "So you decided to travel by first class?" asked Rekha. "Good.
Good. It is much better isn't it?"  </p>


<p> "Well, I kind of expected it to have better seats at least" said
Tara. "It is no different from the second class compartment except
that it is less crowded." </p>
 
<p> "Yes. No beggars. No sellers. Better crowd" said Rekha. </p>

<p>  Rekha and Tara sat together in adjacent seats. </p>

<p> "Kala and Sunita will join us soon in Matunga" said Rekha. </p>

<p> After a couple of stations Kala and Sunita entered the
compartment. They just stood near Tara and Rekha since there were no
seats left. They asked around about people's destinations so that they
could occupy their seats when they got off the train. The girls had a
long journey ahead of them. Sunita found a passenger who would get
down at Dadar and she reserved that seat. Kala did not find a seat
till Charni Road which was further off. In the meanwhile, the girls
took turns at sitting down. </p>

<p>  "I have been reading this book on palmistry" said Kala. </p>

<p> "Read my palms" said Sunita. </p>

<p> "Your life line is long" said Kala. "You will live to at least
eighty."  </p>

<p> "Oh no! That is not good" said Sunita. "Who wants to live that long?" </p>

<p> "Read  my palms" said an elderly lady who was sitting nearby. </p>

<p> Kala was a little overwhelmed at the lady's Grey hair and said </p>

<p> "I am not that good at palm reading. I just started reading the book
yesterday." </p>

<p> "I can predict future with hundred percent accuracy" said Tara. "But I
need a ball pen for it." </p>

<p> "Read my palm then" the lady insisted. </p>

<p> Tara's friends knew the trick that Tara was up to. </p>

<p> "No, no. Tara this lady is too old for that kind of palm reading"
said Rekha. </p>

<p> "Leave the poor lady alone" protested Sunita. </p>

<p> "Why? Why should she not read my palms?" asked the lady. </p>

<p> "You see, we give hundred percent guarantee that our predictions will be
correct" Tara  explained. "But the results tend to annoy some people."  </p>

<p> "I will not be angry. I promise" said the Lady. </p>

<p> "You asked for it' warned Tara.  "Don't go getting angry with me after
wards." </p>

<p> "I will not get angry" said the lady. </p>

<p> So Tara made a little table in the lady's palms and asked a lot of questions
like </p>

<p> "What do you like? Triangles or squares?" </p>

<p> "Triangles" the lady said and Tara filled a square in the table with
triangles. </p>

<p> "What do you like? Horizontal stripes or vertical stripes?"  </p>

<p> "Vertical" said the lady. </p>

<p> Tara drew vertical stripes in one box of the table. </p>

<p> After Tara filled all the boxes of the table Tara said </p>

<p> "Okay, here is your future. After reading all the answers I predict
that in the immediate future you will spend a lot of time washing your
hands with soap." </p>

<p> "What a silly trick!" The lady said angrily. </p>

<p> "Remember your promise" said Tara. </p>

<p> "What a silly trick" the lady repeated angrily but now the whole
compartment was laughing. The lady looked too dignified to be fooled
like that and that made the trick all the more funny. There she sat in
a silk sari looking very prim and proper and her palm filled with ball
pen drawings. She looked rather silly. The lady was visibly angry and
the girls sat quietly suppressing their giggles. The lady finally got
down at a station. </p>

<p> "Tara, you should not play tricks like that on old ladies" said Sunita. </p>

<p>  "Serves her right. She should not be asking young girls like us to
read her palms. She should know better" said Rekha. </p>

<p> "I was just kidding around and she promised not to get angry"
said Tara with a grin. </p>

<p> Suddenly they heard a lot of loud exclamations from women in the
compartment. </p>

<p> "You lech. You monkey. No shame. Shameless twit." </p>

<p> Tara and her friends decided to explore what is going on. They could
see that a bunch of ladies were hitting somebody with their handbags
and they were shouting </p>

<p> "Shameless. Monkey. Donkey. Lecher." </p>

<p> "Who are they hitting? What is going on?" asked Tara. </p>

<p> "Some  boy got into the ladies compartment and the ladies are
teaching him a lesson of his life" said a lady. </p>

<p> And to her surprise Tara saw Rajan, her classmate, being treated
thus. Tara decided to rescue him. </p> 

<p> "He is alright. We know him. Leave him alone." </p>

<p> Tara and her friends moved the ladies away from Rajan. </p>

<p> "How come you got into the ladies compartment?" asked Tara. </p>

<p> "You know I would have missed this train since I got late" said
 Rajan. "I just got into this compartment since I did not want to
 miss the train. I did not expect to be treated thus."  </p>

<p> "Now keep quiet. These ladies may attack you again" said Tara. </p>

<p> In the next stop Rajan got down and went to the next compartment. When
they all got down at VT, Sunita told Rajan  </p>

<p> "You should never get into the ladies compartment. You should always
go to the gents compartment. It is better to miss the train otherwise."  </p>

<p> "What gents compartment?" asked Rajan. "Say general
compartment. There are no gents compartments. If you see all the gents
compartments have women passengers. Do we treat you like this? If a
lady enters the compartment we even try to make space for them. I
cannot believe that women can be so mean."   </p>


<p> Tara and her friends looked at each other. It was kind of funny. Here
was Rajan, a boxing champion, and he was slapped and hit by a bunch of
old ladies.  </p>

<p> "They were calling you some names out there" said Tara hiding a smile.  </p>

<p> "Yes, They were calling you lecher, monkey, and I think someone called
him a donkey too" said Sunita. </p>

<p> "I cannot believe those ladies behaved thus" said Rajan. "They look
so kind and motherly on the road. They were trying to push me out of
the train.  They really can be mean." </p>

<p> "That is too bad" said Tara. "But may be this will sort of teach you
to be always on time? Look for the silver lining in the dark cloud." </p>

<p> "And I think they also called him shameless" said Sunita with a
giggle. Sunita for some reason was recollecting all the names the
women called Rajan. </p>

<p> "I am always on time" said Rajan. "But anyone can get late. Those
ladies are mean I tell you."  </p>

<p> "Yes, they also called him shameless twit. Shameless twit!" said Sunita. </p>

<p> At this point Tara and her friends laughed out aloud. </p>

<p> "You girls find this funny? You girls are mean too?" asked Rajan a
little surprised. </p>

<p> "They called you shameless twit. That is funny" said Sunita laughing. </p>

<p> Rajan got angry. He walked off with hurried steps. </p>

<p> "He did not thank us for saving him. The shameless twit" said Rekha.  </p>

<p> That brought forth a fresh round of laughter from Tara and her friends. </p>

<p> Thus days passed for Tara in a new school among new friends. Every
morning she made this long train journey to college and got back home
late in the evening. </p>

<p> There was only a partial wall between the gents and ladies compartment
because of security reasons. Most of the time during the day the first
class compartments for women were empty. In the past some murders and
robbery had occurred. So now the men and women's compartments were
partitioned in a way so that the men could come to help if need
be. But this meant that the women were constantly ogled at by the men
in the adjacent compartment. And sometimes the men would sing
appreciative songs or make cat calls. It was at times entertaining
and at other times quite annoying.  </p>

<p> One day  a group of boys entered the adjacent compartment and one
boy started singing a song from the Hindi movies.  </p>

<p> "Huzoor, Is kadar bhi na itara ke chaliye .....(which meant do not
walk so proudly)."  </p>

<p> The boy sang beautifully but the girls acted as though they were not
paying attention to him. They did not want to draw any attention to
themselves. But after he finished singing he pointedly asked Tara  </p>

<p> "Did you like my song?"  </p>

<p> "Yes" said Tara and smiled. "You sing very well."  </p>

<p> "Thank you" said the boy really happy. The whole group of boys shouted
with joy. It was as though their day was made because a girl responded
to them.  </p>

<p> "Do you want me to sing another song?" asked the boy.  </p>

<p> "Sure. I have time to kill and you really sing well" said Tara with a
shrug.  </p>

<p> "My stop will come soon. It is too bad I cannot sing another song. But
will you remember my name?" asked the boy.  </p>

<p> "I do not know your name" said Tara.  </p>

<p>"Rajesh. What is yours?" asked the boy.  </p>

<p> "Mamta" lied Tara.  </p>

<p> "Where do you live?" asked the boy.  </p>

<p> "Why do you want to know that?" asked Tara.  </p>

<p> The boy had no reply for that.  </p>

<p> "Just making a conversation" he said.  </p>

<p> "I do not want to tell you that. I hope you don't mind."  </p>

<p> "That is fine" said Rajesh. "It was nice meeting you Mamta."  </p>

<p> When the boys got down from the train they shouted  </p>

<p> "Bye bye, Mamta."  </p>

<p> "Bye" said Tara.  </p>

<p> After the boys were gone Rekha scolded Tara.  </p>

<p> "What were you thinking, Tara?  It is dangerous to talk to strangers."  </p>

<p> "That boy was a true artist" said Tara. "It is my belief that a true
artist understands true admiration. I was acting according to my
beliefs.  Can you deny the fact that he sang beautifully? Moreover he
does not  know my real name."  </p>

<p> "I do not understand you" said Rekha. "What are you reading?"  </p>

<p> "I was reading poetry" said Tara.  </p> 

<p> "I must say normal people do not read poetry. I know that people in
love read poems just to write to each other. Why are you reading
poetry?" asked Rekha.  </p>

<p> "I think poetry catches a fleeting moment permanently" said
Tara. "Look at this poem for instance. It was written in the fifteen
hundreds. It is still floating around in the books."   </p>
 
<p> Tara then read the poem aloud.  </p>

<p> "One day I wrote Her name upon the strand - By Edmund Spenser. <br/>

One day I wrote her name upon the strand,  <br/>

But came the waves and washed it away:  <br/>

Agayne I wrote it with a second hand,  <br/>

But came the tyde, and made my paynes his pray.  <br/>

Vayne man, sayd she, that doest in vaine assay,  <br/>

A mortall thing so to immortalize,   <br/>

For my selve shall lyke to this decay,  <br/>

And eek my name bee wyped out lykewize. <br/>

Not so (quod I) let baser things devize <br/>

To dy in dust, but you shall live by fame: <br/>

My verse your vertues rare shall eternize, <br/>

And in hevens wryte your glorious name. <br/>

where whenas death shall al the world subdew, <br/>

our love shall live and later life renew."  </p>

After reading the poem Tara became contemplative.

<p> "Did you notice the spellings?" asked Tara "It all seems so
wrong. But this poem has lived so many years. Why? There are no great
ideas here either and yet this poem has stood the test of time. Why?
Is it because it captured a true moment of the poet? The moment is
long gone but it lives in his poem." </p>

<p> "I do not care about poetry but you make it sound interesting" said
Rekha. </p>


<p> "Poetry is like a sport. The people who play it enjoy it the most" said Tara. </p>

<p> "I hope those boys don't come back and bother us" said Rekha a little
worried. </p>

<p> "They are gone forever" said Tara. "Have you heard the quote? Do not
look for the wind in the grass. What is gone is gone forever." </p>

<p> "Today you are in a poetic mood" said Rekha. </p>

<p> "All that singing did that to me" said Tara laughing. "Sometimes I
think these train journeys are like life itself. It is a small society
in each compartment. The same group sit for almost an hour traveling
in the same direction. When the destination comes they disperse and go
in different directions. Sometimes there are some newcomers like the
group of boys today. But the next day starts the same way and it is a
monotonic routine." </p>

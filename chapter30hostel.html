<h3> Chapter 30 </h3>
<h2> Hostel life </h2> 

<p> Finally the day arrived when Tara had to move to the hostel. Tara's
brother dropped her to the hostel. All the excitement of hostel life
vanished when she saw her brother to the gate. She became homesick and
wanted to go back with Babu. It was raining heavily and Tara suddenly
wanted to cry. But she started to unpack instead.  Soon there was a
knock at her door. The seniors were going from room to room to meet
the new girls. </p>

<p> "I am Tara. I am a first year masters student"  Tara introduced herself. </p>


<p> "We could do with a Tara" said one senior. "We do not have a Tara
yet but we have three Ashas. It is good you are not  Asha. We cannot
deal with another Asha." </p>

<p> "Are you Asha?" asked Tara unable to resist a wise crack. </p>

<p> "Do not ask questions. Speak only when spoken to" said the senior. </p>

<p> "I thought you were talking to me. Is there someone behind me?" asked
Tara looking behind and this made some seniors laugh. </p>

<p> "You are alright Tara. We will now introduce ourselves. I am Jyoti,
this is Lata, this is Rajini, and this is Dina."  </p>

<p> "Are you arranging your room?" asked Lata. "Keep up the good
work. By the way, you will need curtains. The boys out here can be
quite crazy. They ogle at you using binoculars. You see the ratio of
boys to girls in this campus is quite bad." </p>

<p> "I will keep that in mind" said Tara. "Thank you."  </p>

<p> "Count on us if you need anything Tara" said Rajini. "We are going
to like having you around." </p>

<p> "Go and get you identity card from the administration building" said
Jyoti. "That is the first thing you should get. You will need an
identity card all the time.  It is your ticket to the library, to the
movie shows, to the swimming pool, you name it, the identity card is
everything. If you lose your identity card it is like losing your
identity." </p>

<p> Tara had to stand in a line to get the identity card. There were many
people waiting to get their identity cards. </p>

<p> "Are you new to the campus?" asked a boy standing behind her. </p>

<p> "Yes. Are you new too?" asked Tara. </p>

<p> "No, I just lost my identity card" said the boy. </p>

<p> When Tara got her identity card she said to the boy "I do not want to
lose my identity. I am going to be real careful about my identity
card." </p>

<p> And to Tara's surprise the boy started singing </p>

<p> "Phir miloge kabhi, is baat ka vaada karlo, <br/>
Apni ek aur mulaqat ka vaada karlo  <br/>
(Promise you will meet me again,  <br/>
Promise me one more meeting)." </p>

<p> The seniors were right. There were very few girls in the campus. It
was a big deal for a boy to have a conversation with a girl. No matter
how trivial the conversation was.  Tara just shrugged and went back to
her room.  When she had finished arranging her room it was time for
dinner but she did not feel like getting out of the room.  She really
was homesick. </p>

<p> Finally, Tara decided to go to the dining hall. There were many rows of
tables in the hall. A lot of girls were having dinner and it was quite
noisy. For chapatis (wheat bread) every one had to go in to the
kitchen. Tara saw Mala standing in a line waiting for chapatis. </p>

<p> "I did not know you are already here" said Tara. "It is good to see
a familiar face. Boy! Am I homesick?" </p>

<p> "I am glad to see you too" said Mala. </p>

<p> The cooks surrounded a very large pan and they were making hot
chapatis and when it was ready they would put it on the girl's
plates. When Tara's turn came the main cook asked </p>

<p> "How many chapatis do you want?" </p>

<p> Tara said "Two." </p>

<p> "Here comes two chapatis for you" said the cook.  "So you are a new
student.  Welcome to the hostel. What is your name?" </p>

<p> "Tara." </p>

<p> "Are you are from the south?" asked the cook. </p>

<p> "Yes." </p>

<p> "I could tell. I can always tell our girls from the south.
 Good. Okay Tara, hope you like the food we cook." </p>

<p>  "I am sure I will." </p>

<p> The cook took an immediate liking to Tara mainly because she was from
the south. Tara took sabjis which were kept on a counter in the dining
hall in really huge vessels. Rice and dal (lentils) were also kept in
huge vessels. The curd however was kept in little bowls on a separate
table with a note </p>

<p> "Please take one bowl each only." </p>

<p> "This hostel seems alright" said Mala. </p>

<p> "Let us go for a walk after dinner" said Lata. "That is the best
thing about this campus. It is safe to go out even at midnight."  </p>

<p> "That will be nice" said Tara. </p>

<p> "If you like music, you can get the key to the music cupboard from
me" continued Lata. "I am the music secretary. And for dinner you
can listen to the disc Call of the valley, a favorite of mine." </p>

<p> Saying this Lata went and opened a glass cupboard in the end of the
dining hall and she played the music disc. </p>

<p> "It is beautiful music" said Tara. "The flute sounds make me see
mirages of a mountain valley in my mind." </p>

<p> "That is why I like it so much" said Lata. </p>

<p> Later the girls went for a long walk and Lata showed them all the
important  buildings of the campus. </p>

<p> "It is so quiet" said Tara.  "It is difficult
to believe that this campus is part of Bombay." </p>

<p> Suddenly a boy came up to them and asked them their names. </p>

<p> "Why do you want to know it?" asked Lata angrily. </p>

<p> "I am being ragged" He whispered. "I am a freshie. Sorry about
this." </p>

<p> Sure enough there were a bunch of seniors standing a little away. So
Tara and her friends gave him some fake names and they walked
ahead. But soon they found him running behind them and he asked </p>

<p> "Is there any wish you people have? Any command?" </p>

<p> Then Lata came up with an idea and she shouted aloud
"We do not want you to be ragged anymore." </p>

<p> "One wish granted. He will not be ragged for today at least"
said a grinning senior. </p>

<p> There was not much ragging in Tara's hostel, fortunately. The first
week was all about welcome functions. </p>

<p> "We have attended too many welcome functions" said Tara. "Campus
welcome function, Department welcome function, Freshies welcome
function, so on and so forth. All these functions hardly make me
welcome though.  I miss home like hell."  </p>

<p> "Me too" said Mala. "Moreover we have to put up shows for these
functions.  It sure is weird. If they are welcoming us they should act
out a play, sing a song, etc. They expect us to entertain them.  Some
welcome!" </p>

<p> "What should we do for the hostel welcome function on Thursday?" asked
Meena. </p>

<p> "Let us do a Kohli (Fisherwoman) dance" said Mala. "That is the
easiest dance to learn." </p>

<p>  Came Thursday and so did the welcome party. Tara and her friends did a
Kohli dance which they managed to learn in an hour and the seniors
were quite pleased with the effort. The Thursday dinner was called Dry
dinner which was a strange combination of pulao, potato vada,
chutney, fruit custard, and gulab jamun. </p>

<p> "They must be giving us this good dinner because they want us to
come back next week" said Meena and everyone laughed. On Friday
they were more than willing to go home.  Tara was really happy
to be home with her mother. </p>
 
<p> "Ma. I missed you so much" said Tara. </p>

<p> "I missed you a lot too Tara" said Tara's mother. "I did not feel
like doing anything this whole week. My child, you are my source of
joy."  </p>

<p> "Nothing like a little distance to make the heart fonder" said
Tara. "All this time you said mean things about me." </p>

<p> The ball was in Tara's court and she was feeling rather important.
Her mother did not make any sarcastic remarks because she really had
missed Tara quite a bit. </p>

<p> That weekend was rather a relaxing weekend since everyone gave Tara
a lot of importance and told her how much they missed her. But time
passed and Tara could see that nature abhorred vacuum and her space
in the house was slowly  disappearing. Her shelves and table were all
gone. </p>

<p> "Soon you people will forget that I even lived here" sulked Tara. </p>

<p> "Do not say such hurting things" said Tara's father. "What is the
point in keeping shelves empty? When you come back from the hostel we
will empty any cupboard you like." </p>

<p> "Yes, I know. But I just said that to remind you that I exist if you
have chosen to forget about me." </p>

<p> Back at the hostel too, the dry dinners were not as interesting as it was
at first. </p>

<p> "I am sick of the same pulao, potato vada, fruit custard, and gulab
jamun" said Tara.  "It even tastes the same every Thursday. I do not
know why I particularly hate dry dinners."  </p>

<p> "I hate it too" said  Mala. "I would not feed this to my
worst  enemy. That  gives me  an  idea. We  should feed  dry
dinner to our classmate Buntu. That will serve him right for
being so obnoxious." </p>


<p> This idea created a lot of mirth for Tara and Mala.  </p>

<p> "He will say good good after every bite he takes in that sick voice"
said Mala. </p>
 
<p> Tara imitated Buntu saying good good. </p>

<p> "Buntu will be so happy he is invited to dinner" said Mala. "Little
will he know that he is going to be fed dry dinner. He will choke
after the first mouth full."  </p>

<p> "Yes, After he says good good good he will choke" said Tara.</p>

<p> Mala and Tara laughed and laughed at the thought of inviting
Buntu to dry dinner. </p>

<p> Later that night Tara wrote in her diary </p>

<p> "For some reason I am not able to open my soul to this new crowd. My
conversations are frivolous. There is not enough time to make lasting
friendships. The whole exercise of making friends seem somehow
futile. Losing my good friends again and again over time is making it
hard for me to make real connections.  I might be one of the most
popular girls in the hostel and yet what is the measure of popularity?
It is reduced to the number of people you smile at and exchange a
meaningless greeting. There are people around me who envy me even for
that.  I think I may get out of here without having made a real
friend.  Why did I change so suddenly? Is it me or is it the crowd? I
will never know." </p>

<p> But as time went by Tara met many interesting people who would leave a
lasting impression on her in spite of her initial resistance to connect
with people. </p>

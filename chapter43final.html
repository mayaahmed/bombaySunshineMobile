<h3> Chapter 42  </h3>
<h2>Tara's wedding </h2>

<p> Tara's Masters program was coming to an end soon. Many of Tara's
classmates were going for further studies to earn a PhD. Some had
moved to management studies. Some others had taken up well paying
jobs. But Tara now was preparing for her wedding. She would think of
her future plans after her marriage. All her career plans now would
involve Arjun. It was a point of no return. </p>

<p> Tara and Arjun had decided on a simple court wedding with three
witnesses. Tara was staying true to the oath she took many years ago
of not paying a dowry which now also included not having a lavish
wedding.  Tara went to buy a mangalsutra (a gold chain married women
wore) with Mala and Arjun. </p>

<p> "Please show us that mangalsutra" said Tara to the Goldsmith. </p>

<p> The Goldsmith looked at Tara incredulously and he brought out the
mangalsutra out of the glass case hesitantly. Young people never went
to buy mangalsutras on their own. If some one was getting married they
would usually be accompanied by elders for purchasing gold. </p>

<p> "You look so young. He cannot believe that you are planning to get
married. He is suspicious of the entire thing" said Mala
laughing. </p>

<p> "I think I will take this one. It is nice and simple" said Tara choosing
a mangalsutra. </p>

<p>"Wear it and see whether you like it" said Arjun. </p>

<p> "Oh no! One cannot wear it before one is married. It is a strict no, no"
said Tara. </p>

<p> On the wedding day, Tara was sitting in the hostel mess and sipping
tea. No one around her knew she was getting married. When she got back
to her room she felt a catch at her stomach. She knew she was
scared. She finished her packing. Arjun and Tara would leave for a
short honeymoon as soon as they were married at the court. There was a
knock at her door.  She opened it to let Arjun in. </p>

<p> "I am scared, Arjun. This is a big step" said Tara. </p>

<p> "Do not worry. Everything will be fine" said Arjun. </p>

<p> Arjun carried Tara's bag outside and Tara saw a  few friends waiting
for them. </p>

<p> "She is scared" said Arjun laughing. </p>

<p> "Do not be afraid. We all are here to make sure you will be happy" said
Sanjay who was a friend of Arjun. Somehow that statement was
reassuring and Tara smiled. </p>

<p> "We should go, else we will be late. Hey, there is the bus. Let us
catch it" said Sanjay. </p>

<p> The group ran to catch the bus and they managed to catch it.
It so happened that they had to run to catch the train to town. </p>

<p> "It is so funny. No one I know ever ran to catch a bus and train on their
wedding day" said Tara. </p>

<p> "Remember you wanted it this way" said Arjun. </p>

<p> "Yes, I like this part" said Tara. </p>

<p>  When they reached town Arjun said </p>

<p> "We still have an hour to kill before the time allotted for our wedding
in the court. Let us get something to eat." </p>

<p> The little group drank coconut water and ate pav bhaji from a street
stall.  The bill was fifty five rupees and Arjun paid the bill. </p>

<p>  "Contrast fifty five rupees to a minimum of one lakh rupees people spend
on weddings today. This sure is a smart way to get married" said Sanjay.  </p>

<p>  "Thanks, Arjun'' said Tara. "Many of my friends wanted to get married
this way but when their time came, they could not because their
husbands were not tough enough to withstand family pressures. I am
glad, I am able to marry according to my principles."   </p>

<p>  When Tara and Arjun reached the judge's office, the clerk told them
they had to fill a form. They filled the form in a hurry and went back
to the judge, but they had to wait since someone else was getting
married.  But the wait was not long since civil marriage proceedings
lasted only five minutes. When it was Arjun and Tara's turn they had
to sign a document and read a simple one line oath each. The three
witnesses signed the same document and the judge congratulated them
and it was over.  </p>

<p>  Tara was in a daze when she stepped out of the office and Arjun put the
mangalsutra around Tara's neck. She was now married. There was a little
celebration and people were taking pictures of her and talking. But Tara
heard nothing.  </p>

<p>  Soon it was time to leave for the honeymoon. Tara and Arjun left the
little crowd of friends behind to catch a boat to Alibaug.  </p>

<p> "Wait here. I will get the tickets for the boat" said Arjun and left the
bags with Tara.  </p>

<p> Tara could not believe she was married. She held the mangalsutra around
her neck in her hand for sometime.  </p>

<p>  "Am I married? Really?" she asked herself. </p>

<p> She looked around and it was a strange place. The crowd around her was
strange.  She felt the catch in her stomach again. What was she doing
here? She wanted to go back home when she saw Arjun's smiling face
return. He had the tickets in his hands. He put it in his wallet,
picked up all the bags, and said </p>

<p> "Let us go, Tara. My wife." </p>

<p> Tara smiled and gave him her hand. It was a new life and a new
beginning.  </p>

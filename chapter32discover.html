<h3> Chapter 32  </h3>
<h2>Discovering rural India </h2>

<p> Tara soon began to travel to the interiors of Maharashtra with a group
of students from the Indian University. </p>

<p> "It is a wonder how your parents let you travel now that you are
older" said Seeta. They reminisced about the times when Tara's parents
would not give permission for overnight trips. </p>

<p> "I have figured out a trick that works quite well" said
Tara. "Instead of asking my father for permission to go somewhere, I
just tell him I am going. Since he does not like to contradict me,
this trick works quite well. Moreover for some reason they trust me
now." </p>

<p> Traveling educated Tara like nothing else did. Every where she went
she learned new things about people and places. In some of the
villages Tara visited there were groups of huts built away from the
main village.  The huts were made of mud and leaves whereas the
village houses are made of bricks and stones.  A group of such huts
formed a pada.  This was where the tribal people lived. The tribal
people were also called Adivasis which meant indigenous people. The
tribals were considered lower castes and hence had to live away from
the main village. The tribals had a primitive lifestyle and
traditionally lived off the forests. After the forests were gone, they
had taken to farming for the villagers. </p>


<p> Tara walked among the houses in the padas with other people from her
group. Most houses did not have any doors. A lot of houses were empty. </p>

<p> "No one steals anything here" one Adivasi woman explained to Tara.
"We hardly have anything." </p>


<p> "Why are these houses empty?"  asked Tara. </p>

<p> "Now it is summer and the people have gone to the cities to work"
explained the  Adivasi woman. "They will come back during the
rainy season when there is work here." </p>

<p> "There is no robbery here" said an old lady smiling. "We all help
each other. If someone's house gets messed up in the rain, we help
build their house. We are all friends here." </p>

<p> "In fact, if there is a wedding the groom's family feeds his guests and
bride's family feeds her guests" said the first Adivasi woman. "Also
the guests bring ingredients for the meal. We all help each other
here." </p>


<p> "That is an interesting tradition compared to what we have in the
city" said Tara. "In the city the bride's family has to face the
burden of the wedding expenses. We have a lot to learn from you."  </p>

<p>  That statement  made  the women  surrounding Tara  very
happy. They all smiled and  invited her to their homes. Tara
entered one  house which was practically  empty. But somehow
it  was warm,  welcoming, very  aesthetically  pleasing, and
relaxing to Tara. </p>

<p> "I like your house. It is so well kept. What is that fruit hanging
on the wall?" asked Tara. </p>

<p> "It is from the forest. Taste it, it is sour" said the woman. </p>

<p> Tara couldn't eat much of the fruit and she made a wry face which made
the women laugh. </p>

<p> "What is that on the floor?" asked Tara. </p>

<p> "That  is a distillery" explained the woman of the house. </p>

<p> "What is a distillery?" asked Tara. </p>

<p> "That is how you make alcohol" said the woman. "If the police catches
us, we have to pay fines. We have to do this secretly. Sometimes there
are raids. Alcohol is a problem here. The men drink heavily." </p>

<p> Tara stayed in the house of a village Panchayat leader. When Tara got
back to her host's house, she watched the women cook bakhris (bread)
on firewood for sometime. Then she took her diary and went to the
fields and sat on a mound of mud reflecting on the things she
had seen and heard that day. Soon the sun set and the sky was a
picture of bliss. </p>

<p> She wrote: </p>

<p> "It is so peaceful here. Man appears to be a part of nature.  Man is
meant to live like this with open spaces and soothing trees with
nature providing adventure and not in crowded cities where you step
out of your apartments only to go somewhere." </p>

<p> A little before dinner time the group of students gathered in a circle
to discuss the experiences of the day. </p>

<p> "Let us talk about what we learned today" said Dharam. "We will take
turns to tell each other what were our impressions of this day. Let me
start with what I learned. I noticed that the people in the padas are
uneducated and extremely poor. The men I heard spend all their income
on alcohol intensifying the already existing poverty." </p>

<p> After Dharam the students spoke when it was their turn to speak. </p>

<p> "I noticed that the rural women work very hard" said Lata. "They do
manual labor, they raise children, and also take care of their drunk
men. The women here are exploited."  </p>

<p> "I can  sympathize with the men drinking  in this place"
said  Jain. "I  can sympathize  with people  who  are manual
laborers drinking  alcohol. It is  a hard life.  Plowing the
field,   being  undernourished,   being  the   insulted  and
humiliated, and  being underpaid is  not easy. The  men here
drink  to  escape  the  pains  which  are  both  mental  and
physical." </p>

<p> "I noticed that the problems these poor people have are similar to
the problems poor people have in Bombay" said Tara. "In fact these
people have better homes. I have changed my opinion about the
reservation policy of the government for scheduled tribes. There was a
lot of hue and cry over having seats reserved in colleges and schools
for scheduled tribes and castes last year.  The protests involved self
immolation by young people. At that time I was against the reservation
policy too.  I thought that everything should be purely merit based.
But after coming here I noticed that all those special concessions the
government has made for these people have not reached them at
all. These people don't even know about their special rights. Those
concessions are being exploited by a corrupt system." </p>

<p>  "I agree" said Lata. "I think if people actually came and saw how
the scheduled tribes lived the protests would be of a different
kind. These people are taking no concessions. They live by the sweat
of their brow."</p>

<p> And the group began to discuss about how to spread awareness and
education till it was time for dinner. They were served bhakri,
dried peas curry, rice, and lentils for dinner. Tara and some of
her friends had never eaten bhakri which was made of jowar. </p>

<p> "Why do they make bhakri only in the villages?" asked Tara. </p>

<p> "I think it comes out better on fire wood" said Lata. "May be they
do not have enough wheat and we have wheat in the city. I am not sure.
But I know it is tougher to eat bhakris than rotis. But I like bhakris." </p>

<p> Tara watched Lata eat bhakri and she was pulling and tearing at it
with her teeth. </p>

<p> "You look like a little wild animal tearing at its prey. Kind of cute
the way you eat bhakris" said Tara laughing. </p>

<p> After dinner Tara sat out in the courtyard of the house she was living
in. </p>

<p> "Isn't it nice that we can come and stay in this house for free?"
asked Lata. "That is the nice part of rural India where the homes are
welcoming.  Here in rural India one understands what people mean when
they talk about traditional Indian hospitality." </p>

<p>  "True" said Tara. "Look at the sky. Without the street lights the
stars are so bright." </p>

<p>  Dharam explained the constellations to them. </p>

<p>  "The inverted V you see there  is the constellation Taurus. The R shaped
formation is Orion ..." </p>

<p>  After some time he asked </p>

<p>  "Tell me what is that sideways M Tara?" </p>

<p>  "I wouldn't know" said Tara completely embarrassed that she had
forgotten what Dharam had called it. </p>

<p>  "It is Cassiopeia" explained an exasperated Dharam. He then went on to
name a few more constellations. </p>

<p>  Later that night Tara wrote in her diary </p>

<p>  "This little group of people are dreamers like me. We dream of
an ideal world and we are willing to work towards it. Our methods
maybe sloppy or maybe it will get us nowhere. But we are not
afraid to try and we do not care if it does not work. But we
definitely will give it a shot." </p>

<p> Tara looked around the room she was sleeping in. The walls were made
of mud and  the floor was smeared with cow dung. She continued writing </p>

<p> "In the morning I will wake up to the chirping of birds and
the sound of the women sweeping the yard. Both melodious sounds
in its own way greeting the sunrise. This is when you are in harmony
with existence and life is beautiful and stands still for some time." </p>

<p> Tara  closed the diary and watched  the flickering light
from the lamp in a corner  of the room for sometime and then
she shut her eyes to listen to the sounds of the night. When
Tara woke up  in the morning, it was very  cold. She went to
the kitchen  and sat near the  fire. The woman  of the house
offered her a cup of tea and that made her warm. </p>

<p> "It gets real cold here. In Bombay it is never cold. But this
tea took care of the cold" said Tara. </p>

<p> Tara stepped out into the yard and she watched a woman feeding
the chicken grains. </p>

<p> "Have you noticed that the sounds of the morning are rather busy
sounds? The chickens act as though they have a lot of important things
to do and eat their breakfast in a hurry" said Lata joining Tara. </p>

<p> "Yes" said Tara. "It is kind of busy in the mornings. The sounds are
all breakfast sounds. The cow eating grass and drinking water, the
chicken eating grains, and the birds eating worms. Yuck." </p>

<p> "The chicken eat worms too. Double yuck" said Lata.</p>

<p> Tara and Lata took a walk along the fields and they stopped when they
saw a stream. Women were washing clothes at the stream and they hit
the clothes against the rocks as they washed. </p>

<p> "Where are you from?" asked one woman. </p>

<p> "We are from Bombay" said Lata. Lata then explained that they were
visiting the village with a group of students from the Indian
University. </p>

<p> "There is a wedding this evening. Will you two come for it?" asked the
woman. </p>

<p> "Sure" said Tara and got the details of where the wedding was going to
be. </p>

<p> "Come with all your friends. It is a rich man's wedding. There will be
horses and a baraat. You will like it very much." </p>


<p> So that evening Tara and her friends went to the wedding.</p>

<p> "Since we are from the boy's side, we will take a baraat and go to the
bride's house" said one woman. "When we go in the baraat you girls
must dance."  </p>

<p> Tara and Lata looked at each other a little shocked at what they heard
and they of course refused to dance. They joined the baraat. The
bridegroom was seated on a horse and the guests just walked along.
Soon a group of little girls going along in the baraat insisted that
Tara and Lata dance. </p>

<p> "Didi. Didi. Please dance" they pleaded. </p>

<p> "No. No" said Tara. </p>

<p> "But everyone dances. In a baraat people have to dance. We will all
dance" said the little girls. </p>

<p> "So why don't you?" asked Tara. </p>

<p> "First you start didi" said the little girls. </p>

<p> Not wanting to disappoint the little girls Tara finally
said  </p>

<p> "Okay I will sing a song" and the little girls cheered up.  </p>

<p> But to Tara's surprise, the news spread like wild fire. The baraat
stopped completely and the next instant there was a mike in Tara's
hand and all eyes were on her. Now she could not back out and she sang  </p>

<p> "Zindagi jab bhi teri basm mein laati hai hume, yeh zamin chand se
behatar nazar aati hai hume... (Whenever life brings me among your
midst, this world looks better than the moon to me)."  </p>

<p> But what Tara did that day was not an everyday event. It was
not every day that some girl sang in a baraat in the middle of
the village street and Tara realized it too late.
But the little girls were very happy.  </p>

<p> "Now you girls will dance wont you?" asked Tara.  </p>

<p> "No" said the little girls.  </p>

<p> "But..."   </p>

<p> "We just said that to make you dance. After all since you are
from Bombay you can do anything" said one girl.  </p>

<p> "Boy! You kids tricked me into doing something stupid" said Tara.  </p>
                                                                 
<p> "We are happy and proud that we had someone from Bombay
singing in our baraat. See it was video taped" pointed out a little
girl.  </p>

<p> "It is done now" said Lata smiling.  </p>

<p> "See the bhaus from Bombay are dancing" said the little girls happily.  </p>

<p> Sure enough Tara could see some of the boys from her group dancing.  </p>

<p> "They must have been fooled too like us" said Tara laughing.  </p>

<p> The next place Tara went was to a village where people used small dams
for irrigation. The Indian government spend a lot of money on
irrigation by building big dams. The little village  proved beyond
doubt that the alternative method of small dams that trapped rain
water in the soil was much better than redirecting large rivers from
their natural path. The village was a success story. It was a tedious
bus journey to the village that lasted for more than eight
hours. It was hot and dry and very uncomfortable. But the sight of a
green village after such a long spell of desert like scenery cheered
Tara up.  </p>


<p>  "It is amazing how this little village in rural Maharashtra can be so
green when all the villages around are so dry and ugly" said Tara.  </p>

<p>  "The idea of small dams was implemented by a social worker called
Anna" said Dharam. "We will meet him in this trip. He is staying in
the school hostel."   </p>

<p>  "School hostel?" asked Tara.  </p>

<p> "This school was built by Anna too" said Dharam. "One person can
make a lot of difference. Anna has changed the life of a whole village
and beyond.  This village stands out as an example to the world."  </p>

<p>  The school had become a reputed school.  People from other villages
send their children here to study. The villagers were very proud of
their school. The little group from the Indian university were given
rooms in the school hostel.  Tara and her group sat down to eat lunch
in the lunch area for school children. They were served a simple meal
of rotis, daal, potato sabji, and rice. Tara enjoyed the rustic meal
which had only basic spices. Finally she saw Anna. He came quietly and
sat at one of the benches and ate the same meal the students ate. He
seemed to look at no one. He was the sort of person used to having
people gape at him. People came from all over the country to meet him.  </p>

<p>  "Anna, we are here" said Dharam to Anna. Dharam had already contacted
Anna and informed him about their visit.  </p>

<p>  "Welcome, welcome. Hope you have a pleasant stay" Anna said beaming
a smile.  </p>

<p>  After lunch Anna gave a speech about irrigation with small dams.  </p>

<p>  "These dams that we built here are built with money from the villagers.
We needed no loans from outside. We pooled this money because we believed
in the future. All those who contributed got back their money when their
crops did well and they had enough water. We are living the dream of
Gandhiji of a self sufficient village. I hope other villages follow
our example."   </p>


<p>  "But not every village has a Anna" someone said and that made Anna smile. </p>

<p>  "This is a strategy of irrigation that works" said Anna. "The rain
water before it goes to the sea must be stopped. It is a simple
concept and is part of the Indian irrigation system for a long
time. The kings used to built tanks to store water. But nowadays
people ignore these kind of irrigation systems. They want to bring
high technology and they forget to make use of what is available
first. Let me extend my welcome to all the visitors to our village
again. Thank you for coming. Please feel free to go and look around
the village.  Welcome."   </p>

<p>   Anna then left. They did not see him again. That day the group walked
 around the village and talked to the villagers. Later in the evening
 Dharam talked to the group about how big dams created problems.
 People were dislocated from their ancestral lands. Big dams caused
 earthquakes and deforestation. </p>

<p> When Tara  got back to her hostel  she fortified herself
with books  on the big dams controversy.  She poured through
the books for  a few days and nights.  And Tara decided that
big dams are evil. When  Tara went home for the weekend, she
pointed out  an article about people  protesting against big
dams in the newspaper to her father and said </p>

<p> "Papa, after my trip I know that we do not need big dams for irrigation.
Why is the government so insistent on building big dams even when there
are so many protests?"  </p>

<p> Tara then went on to describe what she had read about the evils of big
dams. Tara's Military uncle was present and he gave a roaring laughter
and said

<p> "You may feel bad about people getting dislocated but let me ask you
one question. You must answer honestly. You live in Bombay and we
have rare power cuts. We are lucky. If you go to other cities there
are frequent power cuts. Do you know why we have all this electricity?
It is because of the big dams. Now tell me, if you had frequent power
cuts would you like it?" </p>

<p> "No. I would hate it" said Tara.  </p>

<p> "So let us not be hypocrites. We all know that cities need electricity and
hence big dams" said Military uncle. </p>

<p> Tara did not have a reply for it and she only said </p>

<p> "I need to think about this. This is a new thought. I hate it that you
put this view point and confused me. But I guess now I will have to
sort out whether big dams are evil or not." </p>

<p> Tara went out of the house to the veranda and she stood there for
sometime pondering about big dams. </p>

<p> "Sabji walla" shouted the vegetable seller. He came every evening
to sell vegetables and he lingered a little below each building. He
looked up and saw Tara and he smiled and asked </p>

<p> "Do you need any sabji?" </p>

<p> "I don't know. I will ask mother" said Tara. </p>

<p> Tara's mother said </p>

<p> "Yes, go get some coriander leaves for one rupee. I forgot all about
it when I went to the market." </p>

<p> So Tara went down to buy the coriander leaves. It was a narrow road
and the hand cart had hogged up almost all the road. One car
wanted to pass and the vegetable seller seeing the car gave a sheepish
grin and said </p>

<p> "Ek minute bhai sahab (One minute please)." </p>

<p> He then moved the cart to an edge of the road and the car passed
 slowly by. The vegetable seller then continued selling his vegetables
 again. </p>

<p> "That is it. I have it" said Tara to herself. It was her Eureka
 moment. She rushed home with the coriander leaves and told Military
 uncle </p>

<p> "We need both the big dams and the small dams. There should be no
 conflict here. The conflict is caused by vested interests. Just
 because the government is building big dams need not mean they should
 not build small dams. Just because the small dams are good need not
 mean that big dams are not useful. For some reason big dams and small
 dams are pitted against each other when they could easily exist
 together." </p>

<p> "You have something there. Write that down" said Military uncle laughing. </p>

<p> "I figured this out from the sabji walla" said Tara. </p>

<p> "How on earth did the sabji walla tell you all this?" asked a
surprised Military uncle but Tara did not bother to explain. </p>

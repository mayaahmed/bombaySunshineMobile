<h3> Chapter 38  </h3>
<h2>A woman's work is never done </h2>


<p> Tara visited Manda on her birthday. </p>

<p> "Happy Birthday Didi" said Tara as Manda opened the door. Tara then
gave her a bunch of flowers. </p>

<p> "Thank you" said Manda smiling. </p>

<p> "Here are the clothes and gifts mother send. Here is the payasam (rice
pudding) Ma made" said Tara handing everything to Manda. </p>

<p> Manda kept the gifts unopened on a table nearby and went back to the
kitchen. It was breakfast time. Ajit, his mother, and Manda's son were
eating breakfast. Manda was making hot parathas (bread with some
filling) and giving them to eat. </p>

<p> "Was it your birthday today? I completely forgot" said Ajit. </p>

<p> "Happy Birthday, Ma" the little kid shouted. </p>

<p> "Yes, Happy birthday Manda. I totally forgot" said Ajit. </p>

<p> "Happy birthday" said Manda's mother in law a little grudgingly. </p>

Tara followed her sister to the kitchen and said </p>

<p> "I will roll out the rotis for you." </p>

<p> Tara helped her sister in the kitchen. </p>

<p> "Give me some water. You put so much chillies in the filling.
I have acidity and cannot eat chillies" complained the old lady. </p>

<p> "I am sorry Ma" said Manda. </p>

<p> "I am surprised at how much you love your daughter in law" said Tara. </p>

<p> "What?" asked the old lady completely taken by surprise. </p>

<p> "You know if something were not up to my taste, I would not be able to
eat a bite. But you seem to have suffered through many a bites before
giving up" said Tara sarcastically. </p>

<p> "Ahhh..." said the old lady not sure whether Tara had praised her
or insulted her. </p>

<p> "I do not understand. It is your birthday and you are slogging like a
slave. Back at home everyone would pamper you so much on your
birthday" said Tara.  </p>

<p> "Everyone has to grow up. Now I pamper my son like our mother pampered
us" said Manda. </p>

<p> "But I still feel you deserve better on your birthday" said Tara
making a face. </p>

<p> Manda had no time to reply. She was very busy in the mornings. After
making breakfast, Manda made Ajit's lunch box, then went inside to iron
Ajit's clothes. </p>

<p> Tara helped Manda's son Sunny prepare an article for school. There was
a chart full of pictures of birds and animals and they had to cut
pictures and paste it on a notebook and describe it briefly in the
article. </p>

<p> "Cutting pictures out of a chart is fun" said Tara and Sunny agreed. </p>

<p> "I like pasting them on notebooks" added Sunny. </p>

<p> "Sunny, come say good bye to Daddy" called out Manda. </p>

<p> And Sunny went running out of the room and Tara followed to see what is
going on. </p>

<p> "I am sorry I forgot your birthday Manda. Let us go out for a movie
and dinner tonight" said Ajit.  </p>

<p> Tara could see Manda's face light up with joy. </p>

<p> "I cannot go. I am feeling feverish" said the old lady. </p>

<p> "Sunny and Ma can stay back" said Ajit. "We will tell the
neighbors to keep an eye. But we will surely celebrate Manda's
birthday. Wont we?"  </p>

<p>  Manda could not hide her happiness and her face was filled with
 joy. But the old lady did not like the scene that much. </p>

<p> "I am dying of thirst" said the lady. "Can someone get me some hot
 tea or would you rather watch me die without a cup of tea?" </p>

<p>"I will make it in a minute, Ma" said Manda and after a hurried goodbye
Ajit left.</p>

<p> Tara watched Manda as she made tea. </p>

<p> "No sympathy for old people in this house. You will be roaming around
leaving sick people at home" complained the old lady from the hall.</p>

<p> "If someone talked to me in that tone, she will hear a word or two" said
Tara.</p>

<p> "Tara, tell me honestly. If an old lady asks you for tea, wouldn't you
make it for her?" asked Manda. </p>

<p> "Yes, I would" said Tara. </p>

<p> "Then what is the point of arguing? It saves a lot of energy if you avoid
arguments" said Manda. </p>

<p> "You have a point" said Tara laughing. </p>

<p> Tara watched her sister work around the house and it seemed like the
work never got over. Sunny would drop something and Manda would clean
up after him. She was getting medicine for the old lady, taking care
of the laundry, taking care of Sunny's studies, and after hours of
slogging, there was nothing to show. The food Manda had cooked was
eaten and the spots she had cleaned were dirty again. It was a never
ending cycle of chores. </p>

<p> "Happy birthday, didi" said Tara once again while leaving. On the way home
Tara met Sarita and said </p>

<p> "I am surprised at my sister. She does so much for others and expects so
little in return. She could go for ten movies on her own and yet
Ajit wanting to take her out for a movie after completely forgetting about
her birthday made her really happy. She is always thinking husband, kid,
husband's family, and Ajit hardly thinks about her. I think this is a
little unfair."   </p>


<p>"That is the way men are" said Sarita. "That reminds me of a little
prank I played on my husband  last week. You must hear about this." </p>

<p> Sarita then paused to laugh before continuing. </p>

<p> "The other day Piyush came home early from work. He cleaned up the
house, made a real nice dinner, set the table, and waited for me to
get back from work. I would say he even dressed up a little." </p>

<p> "Vow. That is different" said Tara.</p>

<p> "When I came back from work, I sat at the table and started eating
dinner without a word of appreciation" said Sarita giggling. </p>

<p> "Boy!" said Tara. </p>

<p> "Piyush kept waiting for me to say something about the clean floor or
the wonderful dinner but I said nothing. After sometime he was very
angry.  He said that he had worked so hard and he could not understand
how I had no words to thank him. Then I said that is what he did to me
everyday.  That made him think" said Sarita. </p>

<p> "I bet it did" said Tara laughing. </p>

<p>  After some time Sarita  said </p>

<p> "I have been traveling and seeing a lot of rural India. I have something
really interesting for you. There is a small village near Bombay where
they are doing some development work. You should work there. You will
love it."  </p>

<p> "What do I have to do?" asked Tara. </p>

<p> "All sorts of work. Documenting, herbal medicine, exploring rural
technology, anthropology, natural history. You can do all that. Tara,
this job is made for you." </p>

<p> "As soon as I am done with my Masters I will go there" said Tara. </p>

<p>  "Finish your Masters first" said Sarita taking her leave. </p>

<p>  Later, when Tara told Seeta about her plans for a career in rural
development, Seeta said </p>

<p> "I bet your parents will never let you do that." </p>

<p>  "I will convince them for I have my ways" said Tara thinking about that
aspect. "I must break the news to them slowly and prepare them for it." </p>

<p>  "No way, Tara. Your father will marry you off immediately if you even
mention such things" said Seeta. </p>

<p>  Marriage was a threat looming for all the girls who had passed the age of
eighteen. Many of Tara's friends were already married. Once the girl
was married the girl's ambitions were the husband's headaches not the
father's. Tara however had made a deal with her father and she was
free till twenty three. She was not worried for now. </p>

<h3> Chapter 33  </h3>
<h2>Messing around </h2>


<p> As time went by the hostel mess food tasted awful. The mess had a
weekly menu. So every Monday stuffed brinjal was served with
lunch. The taste of the food never changed from one week to the other.
Clearly mother's love was a big factor of creativity in the kitchen.
A new girl at Tara's table was complaining loudly. </p>

<p>  "This food is so spicy. They should put less chillies in it. My mouth is
burning." </p>

<p>  "What's with her?" asked Tara to Mala. </p>

<p>  "That female is US returned" said Mala. "Her name is Vimla. She now
has problems with spicy food." </p>

<p>  Tara watched the new comer. Tara now was no longer a freshie. She was a
senior and she could now look down on freshies and their behavior. </p>

<p> "You see this food is reasonably mild for us" said Meena. "In fact
it is too mild for me.  That is why I have to eat pickles with it." </p>

<p> "This has to stop" said Vimla. "One cannot eat this kind of food
without getting sick.  I think I will become the mess secretary and
then I will change all this.  We will then have some decent food. I
must take up that responsibility and make the mess food edible." </p>


<p> "We will look forward to your becoming the mess secretary with great
fervor" said Mala. </p></p>

<p> "It is not a post that is very popular and you will have no difficulty
becoming the mess secretary" said Tara smiling. "In fact this is the
first time I have heard anyone wanting to become one. Also improving
the quality of the mess food is a topic that is close to the hearts of
a lot of people in the hostel." </p>

<p> "I am forced  to become a mess secretary because this food
is inedible" said Vimla. </p>

<p> The group of girls at the table sympathized with the US returned
freshie because after all she was planning to change all this when her
turn came. </p>

<p> "Unfortunately we will have to wait till the next elections for that"
said Meena with a sigh. </p>

<p> But then Meena had not expected the turn of events that happened next.
Suddenly, a couple of days later there were notices all around the
hostel saying that an outrage had been committed by Dina who was a
mess secretary.  She was to apologize or resign. This issue would be
discussed in a GBM (General body meeting).  The notice also said that
some grave issues will be discussed along with the apology issue. </p>

<p>  "I wonder what is going on. I know Dina. She cannot
commit any outrage" said Tara.  </p>

<p>  "We will find out this evening at the GBM" said Mala.  </p>

<p>  Many girls of the hostel gathered in the dining hall for the
GBM. Rajini who was the general secretary of the hostel began with the
grave issues the hostel face.  </p>

<p>  "We have gathered here today to discuss some grave issues. We will get
to Dina's apology issue soon. Before that I must warn you that things are
changing and we will be slapped with rules. But we must stand united
and face any challenge that face this hostel. We will not accept any
rules that are not acceptable to us ..."   </p>

<p> "I wonder what are these challenges facing our hostel" whispered Mala.  </p>

<p> "Let me ask her" said Tara and she asked aloud  </p>

<p> "What are these threats you are talking about?"  </p>

<p> "We will come to that in a second. We must stand united because
unity is strength..." continued Rajini.  </p>

<p> "But who will slap rules on us? The students decide all the rules here.
What are these threats you are talking about?" a girl asked. </p>

<p> "I can only tell you that we will face tough times soon. We must be
united..." continued Rajini. </p>

<p> At this point Tara decided to give up listening and read
parts of a book through Rajini's monologue which was getting
nowhere.  There were  some girls  in the  audience  who were
getting restless because they  wanted to take up the apology
issue as soon as possible.  After may be Rajini's voice gave
out, or perhaps she sensed  the boredom of the crowd, Rajini
threw the floor  open to discuss the misconduct  of the mess
secretary. </p>

<p> "Dina had guests for dinner on Tuesday night" said a girl called
Arti. "She had a special table set with special vessels for her
guests. This has never happened before.  This is abuse of office
power. She must apologize."  </p>


<p> "These new vessels were bought recently with the extra money the mess
made" explained Dina. "I went and personally bought this for the
hostel. The very purpose of these new vessels are to entertain guests
of the hostelites."  </p>

<p> "But you had so much extra food on your table, Milan had to go hungry
because the mess ran out of food" said Arti. </p>

<p> "She could have very well come to my table and taken whatever food she
wanted" said Dina. "I did not know that the mess ran out of food. I
do not believe it did either." </p>

<p> "Did it run out of food really?" asked Tara. </p>

<p> "No, not all food but the cabbage sabji" said Milan a little embarrassed
about being painted the starving victim. </p>

<p> "See there is a difference in going hungry and not having a sabji for
dinner. But she could have come and taken the food from my table anytime"
said Dina. </p>

<p> But Tara soon sensed that the issue was not important here. It was
some sort of personal fight and a small group of girls wanted Dina to
apologize or resign. </p>

<p> "I will not apologize. Come what may. I will not apologize" said Dina
firmly. </p>

<p> "Let us vote on this. Should Dina apologize else resign?" asked Rajini. </p>

<p> And to Tara's surprise the verdict was either Dina apologizes or she
resigns. </p>

<p> "I will not apologize. I will send in my resignation" said Dina and she
left the hall in a huff. </p>

<p> "If she resigns we need another mess secretary. She was doing a good job.
It will be hard to find another" said Rajini. </p>

<p> "That is not the issue here. This is a matter of principle" said Arti and
a group of girls around her nodded. </p>

<p>  Later Tara visited Dina and said "Why don't you apologize? What does it
matter? It is just a simple word which means nothing if you do not mean it.
We would hate to lose you as a mess secretary." </p>

<p> "I am not going to say sorry" said Dina. </p>

<p> "Okay we will apologize as a mess team then" said Durga who was part
of the mess team. </p>

<p> "You can apologize if you like" said Dina smiling. </p>

<p> So Tara helped Durga pen an apology which went like this </p>

<p> "We are sorry, <br/>

you missed your curry, <br/>

though it was cabbage, <br/>

that tasted like garbage, <br/>

we are sorry, <br/>

that you missed your curry." </p>

<p> They signed it the "Mess team" and put up the apology on the notice
board. Of course Tara and Durga laughed a lot trying out variations of
the apology and finally decided on this one. When Tara met Rajini she
asked </p>

<p> "Okay, so that was an apology. Does Dina stay?" </p>


<p> "The group was not satisfied. We will have another GBM" said Rajini. </p>

<p> Tara wisely decided not to attend the GBM but she heard from Rajini
that Dina had to resign. </p>

<p> "So does Vimla now become a mess secretary?" asked Tara. "Every one knows
that Vimla wanted to become one." </p>

<p> "No. She said she was busy and will become a mess sec next year" said
Rajini. </p>

<p> "Then who is the mess sec now?" asked Tara. </p>

<p> "We will have to do with only one this term. No one else took up
the responsibility" said Rajini and Tara just shook her head in
reply. </p>

<p> Tara wrote down in her diary that night: </p>

<p> "Somehow women change with age. In the Undergrad years women are much
nicer to each other. Older they get, the meaner they become to other
women and maybe nicer to men. Of course it is not a rule but that is a
trend I see." </p>

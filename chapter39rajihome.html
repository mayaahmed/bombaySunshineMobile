<h3> Chapter 39  </h3>
<h2>Raji's new world </h2>

<p> Tara wanted to go for a trip to Katmandu for the Christmas vacations
but the trip was very expensive. Her mother gave her a big lecture
about why they could not afford it. </p>

<p> "What makes a person upper class is not money but the ability to live
within one's income.  Not all times are good, not all generations nor
members of a good family are rich all the time but the difference is
that when you are upper class you learn to do without. Then it makes
no difference whether you are rich or poor." </p>

<p> "I will do my part" said Tara. "I do not want to be the black sheep
of the family after all. So no Katmandu for me." </p>


<p> She went to meet Raji who was visiting her parent's house after a long
time. She was now a stepmother of a young girl. She was also pregnant
and expected to deliver soon. </p>

<p> "It is good to see you again after such a long time" said Tara. </p>

<p> "Have I changed a lot? Have I  put on too much weight?" asked Raji. </p>

<p> "A little" said Tara. "That is natural. A happily married woman
always puts on weight. It is even mentioned in Tolstoy's book Anna
Karenina where Kitty puts on a little weight after she is in charge of
the kitchen. She can get the stuff she really likes made and hence
eats more than necessary.  But you look real nice." </p>

<p> "I must keep a watch on my weight" said Raji laughing. </p>

<p> Raji looked radiant and happy. She wore saris and a lot of nice
jewelry which only married women were allowed to wear. She looked very
grown up. </p>

<p> "Getting married takes you in to the grown up world" said Raji. "It
is not age that makes you mature but experiences. Come for a visit to
Nasik. You have not been to my house yet." </p>

<p> "May be I will come" said Tara. "I wanted to go to Katmandu but the trip
was very expensive. A trip to Nasik is within my budget." </p>


<p> Tara's mother was really glad that there was a substitute trip that
was easily affordable. She encouraged Tara to go for it. So after a
few weeks Tara took a long distance bus and traveled to Nasik from
Bombay.  Raji was there at the bus stop to meet Tara. Raji lived
in a colony made for people who worked for a big company. Raji took Tara
around the colony. </p>

<p> "Here the officers live. Those buildings out there are for the clerks.
The bungalow's are for the big shots."  </p>

<p> When they reached Raji's house,  Raji's mother in law asked
"Was it a good journey?"  </p>

<p> "Yes" said Tara. "Quite comfortable, Thank you." </p> 

<p> "Come and  see my little kid" said Raji animatedly. </p>

<p> Raji took Tara to the room where the baby was sleeping in a
cradle. The old lady followed them to the room too. The three of them
watched the little child for a few moments. The mother and grandmother
whispered about the child to Tara excitedly.  The child coughed in his
sleep and Tara saw Raji wince. </p>

<p> "It is tough to deal with a child's pains" said Raji. "You cannot
communicate with it and ask it exactly how it feels. So you have to
guess. You often guess the worst and worry your head off." </p>

<p> After a few seconds Raji said quietly "You have not loved till you
love a child."</p>

<p> Raji was busy all the time. She had a lot of work around the house.</p>

<p> "I wish I could take you around" said Raji. "There are a couple of
gardens around that is very pretty. You must see them. But I do not
have the time." </p>

<p> "Never mind. I will go alone" said Tara.  </p>

<p> She borrowed Raji's cycle and surveyed the landscape on her own.  Tara
reached a little lake and she stopped a while to watch children play
the game of seven stones. The stones were placed in a pile on top of
each other. There were two teams and one of the teams had to hit the
pile of stones with a ball. When the pile collapsed they would run
and try to put the pile back again. The other team had to  hit the
first team with the ball. If any  member of the first team got hit
by the ball the game was over. And the roles reversed.  Tara smiled to
herself when she thought of how much she had liked this game as a
child. </p>

<p> Raji's daughter Aparna was among the children playing. When she saw Tara
she came running to greet her. </p>
 
<p> "Didi, you are  here!" said Aparna. </p>

<p> "Yes" said Tara. </p>

<p> "Let me introduce you to my friends" said Aparna. Aparna
was very happy to introduce Tara to everyone. Little girls were always
impressed with older girls and they would imitate the dress, style,
and mannerisms every time they met a new didi. Knowing that Tara had to
show off a little more than usual. </p>

<p> "I will teach you a new game. This is called hot cold" said Tara.  </p>

<p>  Tara would blind fold some kid and then hide a ball in some bush.
 The child had to find the hidden ball. If the child went near the
 place where the ball was others would say "Hot, hot, hot."  If the
 child went away from the hiding place then they would say "Cold,
 cold, cold." </p>

<p> The children were really happy with the new game. When it was late
evening, Tara and Aparna had to leave for home. The children asked </p>

<p> "Will you come again to play tomorrow?" </p>

<p> "I do not know" said Tara. </p>

<p> "Please bring didi" said the little girls to Aparna and Aparna said very
confidently </p>

<p> "Yes, I will bring didi along."  </p>

<p> It was strange for Tara to live in another household where the power
relations were so different from her own family.  Tara's family was
liberal and everyone could talk to each other freely whereas Raji's
new family was traditional. There were some strict rules and strict
hierarchies. The father of the family talked little and the women were
very subdued. </p>

<p> "On the one hand we believe we are all the same and yet we are all so
different. We behave so differently as a family unit in society" said
Tara to Raji. </p>

<p> "Do not think too much Tara. Just live life. Too many questions only lead
to trouble" said Raji laughing. </p>

<p> Raji was washing the dishes and her husband came and asked for tea. </p>

<p> "I am busy now. Wait for a few minutes" said Raji gently. Her husband
said </p>

<p> "You are always busy. I do not want tea." </p>

<p> He went away sulking. </p>

<p> "That is the problem with men" said Raji. "They sulk for
everything. It is hard to understand men."  </p>

<p> "This is childish" said Tara. "I cannot believe a grown up man can
sulk because he has to wait a few minutes for tea." </p> 

<p> "Live and learn, Tara. Live and learn" said Raji making a hurried cup
of tea for her husband. </p>

Soon Tara was packing her bag to go back to Bombay. Aparna and her friends
came to say goodbye.

"Tara, you certainly made a lot of friends here" said Raji laughing.

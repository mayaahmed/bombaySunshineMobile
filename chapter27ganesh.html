<h3> Chapter 27  </h3>
<h2> Where do we go from here? </h2>
       

<p> The raddiwalla (junk man) was buying old newspapers from Tara's
mother. He would weigh a large bunch at a time.  It was obvious he was
cheating a lot. </p>

<p> "Weigh properly" said Tara's mother.  </p>

<p> "These raddiwallas always cheat. No point monitoring them" said Tara
laughing.  </p>

<p> "I am not cheating at all. Look I am weighing everything properly"
said the raddiwalla.  </p>

<p> He then peacefully continued with his cheating. After the man was gone
Seeta said </p>

<p> "It is not too much money that you can make by selling old
newspapers. But for some reason the women take it very seriously.
They do not like getting cheated of a rupee." </p>

<p> "That is the strange part of home economics" said Tara. "They go to
a big store and get cheated out of hundreds of rupees but the women do
not complain. A raddiwalla cheats them of a rupee and they lose their
temper big time." </p>

<p> "You are angry only if you can be angry" said Seeta. "This poor man
has not much of a voice and so everyone can scold him." </p>

<p> "Anger is not such a natural feeling then?" asked Tara.  </p>

<p> "Anger is natural but unless you are mad you can control anger
depending on who you are angry with" said Seeta.  </p>

<p> "I think there is more to it than that here" said Tara. "It is the
small thief who gets roughed up when caught. The big thieves have
lawyers and rarely gets punished."  </p>

<p> "It is not a fair world" said Tara's mother. "The sooner you learn
it, the better it is for you."   </p>

<p> A little girl called Priyanka came over to Tara and asked:   </p>

<p> "Didi, do you want to go to the park and pick Hibiscus flowers with me?
My mother wants it for her pooja."  </p>

<p> "Sure. Coming along Seeta?" asked Tara.  </p>

<p> "No.  I cannot go right now" said Seeta and she went home.  </p>

<p> "Let us go" said Tara to Priyanka.  </p>

<p> The two went to a nearby garden and plucked some Hibiscus flowers.
Tara showed Priyanka how to eat pollen and drink nectar from 
Hibiscus flowers.  </p>

<p> "I am a butterfly" said Priyanka.  </p>

<p> A boy came up to where Tara was standing and said  </p>

<p> "See that guy out there?"   </p>

<p> Tara looked up and saw a boy in a slight distance. She had never seen him
before in her life. The boys were playing cricket when she had reached
the garden. Now they  stopped playing and  were  watching Tara.  </p>

<p> "What about him?" asked Tara.  </p>

<p> "He loves you" said the boy.   </p>

<p> Tara looked at the boy at a distance and he had an expressionless
face. Tara did not know what to say and she was very embarrassed. So
she put her head down said  </p>

<p> "Priyanka, let us go home."   </p>

<p> Tara held Priyanka's hand and walked away with quick steps towards her
home. But suddenly instinct told her of danger and she dodged a big
rock that flew past her face. If it had hit her, it would have hurt
her badly.  </p>

<p> "Idiot" shouted Priyanka.  </p>

<p>  "Let us go" said Tara and did not look back. She was badly shaken. </p>

<p> "You should have hit him. You are a coward" said Priyanka like a grown
up person. </p>

<p> "It is a strange society where the male has to propose and face
rejections" said Tara.  "I cannot say I am angry with that boy for
throwing a rock at me but I am sure glad that it did not hurt me." </p>

<p> Tara later went over to Charu's house to learn how to bake plum cakes.
Tara liked going over to Charu's house and admire her paintings.
One particular painting caught Tara's fancy and she said </p>

<p> "This is really one of your best paintings ever." </p>

<p> "That painting I made when I first met my husband" said Charu. "Love
is the only creative force for a woman whether it is life or art. It
may be different for men." </p>


<p> Now this was different. Other women would not talk about love so
openly.  Charu was different from everyone Tara had ever met. Her
intense beauty in the middle class surroundings was itself an anomaly
and she was a misfit. </p>

<p> "You really must try to be a professional painter" said Tara and Charu
nodded no. It was clear that Charu had no intention of making a mark
beyond the four walls of her house. This complete lack of ambition
intrigued Tara. </p>

<p> "Are you happy just staying at home, arranging furniture, and cooking?" </p>


<p> "Tara, it is my philosophy that a woman's role is at home. If you care
about a home then your hands are full of chores and there is no time
for anything else."  </p>

<p> Then why did Charu leave her first husband? That was the question in
the tip of her tongue but Tara did not ask it. It was not her business
and she decided to concentrate on the cakes. </p>

<p> "Sometimes though we do not get what we want" said Charu answering the
question that Tara had in her mind. </p>

<p> "Are you happy now?" asked Tara. </p>

<p> Charu did not answer and she went about mixing the cake dough. There
were no ovens in the households of middle class Bombay, but they had
something called gas ovens. It was an aluminum vessel with a tray at
the bottom to hold sand.  The dough was baked on a gas stove on real
slow fire and it took a long time for each cake to bake. </p>

<p> "These cakes are better than all the cakes in the store" said
Tara. "I wonder why? There is no high tech gadgets here and the
process is cumbersome. Yet this cake is worth every bit of trouble." </p>

<p> "It is easier to send to the baker's to get the cakes baked. But then
those bakers are not very hygienic. It defeats the purpose of baking
at home." </p>

<p> "Now why are you baking all these cakes?" </p>

<p> "For my haldi kumkum pooja in two days." </p>

<p> "I guess you are the only one I know who would take all this trouble of
baking cakes. Others would just get chips and pastries from a store and
make only the til (sesame) laddoos. How many people are you calling?" </p>

<p>  "Only eleven women." </p>

<p>  Numbers like eleven, twenty one, hundred and one, that ended in one,
were auspicious. </p>

<p>   "Am I included?" asked Tara.</p>

<p>  "You can come for the laddoos. But for the Haldi kumkum you will have to
wait till you get married." </p>

<p>  "And that will never be" said Tara. </p>

<p>  "All girls have to get married, Tara. That is the Indian way." </p>

<p> Just then there was a knock at the door and Seeta came over to say </p>

<p> "Dhiraj from your college has dropped by to see you. Your mother
asked me to call you." </p>

<p> "Oh no! That bore" said Tara. </p>

<p> "He seems like a nice guy. Rich, handsome, and all that" said Seeta. </p>

<p>  "But he is spaced out" said Tara. "He has no idea of reality. He is
the kind of person who will say look at the people dying artistically!
Let us click some photos" said Tara. </p>

<p> "Kuch bi kya? (Whatever?)" asked Seeta. </p>

<p> "Come for yourself and see" said Tara. </p>

<p> When the two girls reached Tara's home, Dhiraj had made himself quite
comfortable and Tara's mother was feeding him Pav bhaji. He was
happily eating away which made Tara's mother very happy. </p>

<p> When Tara went into the kitchen Tara's mother said </p>

<p> "Such a rich guy and he still likes our simple food. He really
is enjoying his meal" </p>

<p> "Your cooking is the greatest, Ma. He is lucky to taste it" said Tara
to her mother affectionately. </p>

<p> Well, enjoying the food was mildly put. Dhiraj had finished all the bread
(meant for the entire family) and Tara's mother only said </p>

<p>"Tara, go get some more bread for our guest."</p>

<p>"Oh, is the bread over? They do not call me Jughead for nothing" said
Dhiraj with a grin.</p>

<p>"What is a Jughead?" asked Tara's mother.</p>

<p>"Jughead is a comic book character. He is extremely thin but he can
eat a lot" explained Tara.</p>

<p>"I am really sorry about this. Tara will get some more bread. I am
so glad you like our simple food" said Tara's mother.</p>

<p>So Tara got ready to go to the market when Dhiraj said</p>

<p>"Wait, wait. I will come along. We can go in my car."</p>

<p>So Tara, Seeta, and Dhiraj went to the local market in his car.
Dhiraj put some real classical music on which sounded like someone was
chasing crows and so Tara and Seeta laughed softly at which
Dhiraj said</p>

<p>"Oh, you do not like this music. I do not either. I thought this would
impress you."</p>

<p> "Spaced out" murmured Tara to Seeta. </p>

<p> When they got back home Dhiraj continued his snacking and then he
asked </p>

<p> "Can I see your house?" </p>

<p> "Oh, it is not fancy beta. But you are sure welcome to look around.
Be comfortable please" said Tara's mother. </p>

<p> So Dhiraj looked around and he stopped in front of a glass cupboard
which was full of pots and pans. Now the pots and pans
were in there because this was a nice cupboard and there was nothing
else to put in it.  Tara's mother arranged the pots and pans nicely in
the cupboard. Now to Dhiraj this was completely a fascinating
idea. Why would anyone put pots and pans on display thus?  There
definitely is something to it and after thinking about it for sometime
he asked </p>

<p> "Are these antiques?"  </p>

<p> This made everyone laugh. </p>

<p> "No, they are just pots and pans" said Tara. </p>

<p> "They look like antiques" said Dhiraj which made everyone laugh more. </p>

<p> "Such a nice simple boy" said Tara's mother as Dhiraj left. </p>

<p> "Spaced out" announced Tara and Seeta together laughing. </p>

<p> It was the Ganesh festival so Tara and her friends went to see Ganesh
statues exhibited all over Gandhi market. Every year the market came
up with new and grand ideas.  Last year they had Ganga flowing out of
Shiva's locks. This year they had statues depicting Rama breaking the
bow in Sita's Swayamvar. The shops in Gandhi market pooled together
money for displaying huge Ganpatis. </p>

<p> The girls waited in a line for their turn to do darshan. When Tara's
turn came, she placed her palm on the fire from the burning camphor in
a plate and she placed a rupee on the plate.  She took the laddoo and
coconut piece (prasad) the poojari gave her and she put some red
kumkum on her forehead. She also applied  ground sandalwood paste
on her head. </p>

<p> "I really like the smell of kumkum, sandalwood, and the burning
camphor. It is so heady" said Tara. </p>

<p> "Me too. It brings peace to the soul" said Seeta. </p>

<p> "Ganesh festival is one of the festivals that pull people into
the festivities no matter what religion or part of India you
belong to. It is all part of this great melting pot of a city
called Bombay" said Tara. </p>

<p> "Yes, It does not matter who you are, everyone gets darshan and
prasad. Caste, creed, religion no bar" said Seeta. </p>

<p> "Hey, you sound like a matrimonial ad" said Raji laughing. </p>

<p> "You know if you do darshan of seven Ganpati's each day, you
are supposed to get a good husband" said Seeta. </p>

<p> "We saw more than seven, that might mess up our chances" said
Tara laughing. </p>

<p> "Tomorrow is Ganesh immersion day.  Let us come to Gandhi market at
five in the evening" said Raji. </p>

<p> The next day Tara and her friends were standing on top of a small wall
which lined the main road outside Gandhi market so that they could see
the processions better. </p>

<p> All public transportation was at a stand still. Far and wide Tara
could see trucks after trucks carrying Ganesh statues and people
dancing and singing and throwing red color on the streets and handing
out Prasad.  People also were dancing on the streets and the
procession moved slowly with loudspeakers blaring religious
songs. People who had smaller Ganesh statues would carry it in their
hand.  Everyone kept shouting </p>

<p> "Ganpati papa morya, pudcha varshi laukar ya (which meant come soon
next year in Marathi)." </p>

<p> "Some of these statues are so big and beautiful. I kind of feel bad
that it will get immersed in the ocean soon" said Tara. </p>

<p> "Yes, all good things come to an end" said Raji. </p>

<p> "Tara, our under grad years are coming to an end too. Do you know what
you want to do?" asked Seeta. </p>

<p> "No. I have written tons of entrance exams.  I will write all eligible
entrance exams and see what happens" said Tara. </p>

<p> "I hate these entrance exams. It is just too stressful. I hate all
these application processes" said Seeta. </p>

<p> "No one likes them. These are the bad aspects of life and there is no
escape" said Raji. </p>

<p> When Tara reached home she found her mother was having a little party
of friends and relatives and they all asked her the same question  </p>

<p> "What will you do now Tara?"  </p>

<p> "I do not know" said Tara.  </p>

<p> "Of course you are a girl and you should get married as soon as
possible. That must be the biggest worry for your parents right
now" said an elderly aunty.  </p>

<p> "I want to study further, that is all I know" said Tara.  </p>

<p> "Yes, but what is your aim?  What are your plans?" someone asked.  </p>

<p> Tara shut herself off from the conversation and she could hear
vaguely people  discussing her future plans and she found it
irritating. </p>

<p> "What will you do now?" someone asked and Tara woke up from her trance. </p>

<p> "I do not know" said Tara and she went to her room and closed the door
and she wrote down in her diary </p>

<p> "Where do I stand at this point in my Journey of life? <br/>

I look around me and see a crowd, <br/>

all of them looking more lost than me. <br/>

I try to tell them that they are doing alright, <br/>

and they hang on to all the words that I say. <br/>

As far as others are concerned I can tell, <br/>

That they ought to do this or they ought to do that. <br/>

It is always easy  for me to see other people's lives. <br/>

But who will tell me where do I stand? <br/>

Who will tell me what are my chances? <br/>

I turn around to look for some comfort, <br/>

and all the talk I hear ring hollow in my ear, <br/>

The drift of their talk is I am doing alright <br/>

and they are the ones with all the problems. <br/>

The only person I can turn to it seems is myself, <br/>

and I at this moment don't know what to tell myself. <br/>

Where do I stand?  I have no idea. <br/>

The past or the present gives me no clues. <br/>

Maybe I should take each day as it comes, <br/>

But wont that be fooling with the future too much? <br/>

Will someone please tell me, <br/>

Where do I stand in this journey of life?" </p>

<p> Tara closed her diary and sat with her eyes closed for sometime.</p>

<p> "I do not want to stress myself. Things will be okay. Things will be
alright" she told herself. </p>

<p> Just then her elder brother walked in from outside and called out </p>

<p> "Tara, You passed the Indian University entrance exam. Congratulations." </p>

<p> Tara came running out of her room and snatched the telegram her
brother held in his hand. </p>

<p> "You have been selected for the Masters program at our university.
Please report within two days otherwise we will make this offer
to other people in the waiting list"  Tara read out aloud and she
smiled happily. </p>

<p> "That's a real prestigious university. Good job Tara" said her father. </p>

<p> "I never thought I would pass this exam. It was very tough" said Tara. </p>

<p> "Well, you sure passed that exam" said Tara's brother. </p>

<p> Tara looked at the little crowd gathered in her house and said </p>

<p> "Now I can tell you my plans. I am going to the Indian University for
a masters degree." </p>

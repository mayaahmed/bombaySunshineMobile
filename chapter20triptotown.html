<h3> Chapter 20 </h3>
<h2>Trip to town </h2>

<p> The girls decided to spend the whole day in VT to celebrate Kala's
birthday.  They decide to go to a movie, have lunch at a restaurant,
and then hang around Worli sea face the whole evening. When Tara told
her mother about these plans, her mother said </p>

<p> "Come back before your dad gets home." </p>

<p> "I will, ma" promised Tara. "I will want one hundred rupees too." </p>

<p> "Will that be enough?"  </p>

<p> Her mother always wanted Tara to have everything other girls had. It
did not matter whether it pinched the home budget or not. </p>

<p> "More than enough. I can buy the world with this." </p>

<p> Tara gave her mother a hug and she ran out of the house with the
 money. Tara and her friends then took the train to town. </p>

<p> "It is nice when it is a holiday" said Tara. "The trains are empty
 and you have the whole compartment practically to yourself." </p>

<p>  "As if it matters to you. You are hanging out of the train all the time.
How does it matter whether the trains are empty or not?" asked Sunita. </p>

<p> "Well, It just feels good" said Tara. </p>

<p> Tara and Rekha always stood at the entrance of the compartment with
one foot outside the train. The local trains of Bombay did not have
doors for the compartments. </p>

<p> "Standing here at the entrance, you can feel the speed of the train"
said Tara.  "Sitting inside you do not understand the dynamics of a
train journey.  This journey at this speed is a triumph of human
intelligence. Even you must try this out." </p>

<p> "No thank you" said Sunita. "Human intelligence may be great but
human life is not. I do not like risking my neck for no particular
reason."  </p>

<p> Tara's long hair was flying in the air and she could feel the wind
on her cheeks. Rekha's dupatta was flying too. </p>

<p> "I need to tie my dupatta" said Rekha. "Otherwise it will fly off." </p>

<p> Rekha tied the dupatta around her waist. </p>

<p> "It is also good when there are less people in the train" said
Tara. "Otherwise some lady behind you will complain and ask you to
tie your hair since it would be bothering her face. Today my hair is
free to fly." </p>


<p> Tara and Rekha got down from the train at every station. After all the
new passengers entered the compartment they went back to standing at
the entrance. </p>

<p> "I do not understand the idea of standing at the door. It is so scary"
said Sunita. </p>

<p> "It is not scary at all" said Tara. "Millions of people hang out of
local trains everyday in Bombay. How could this be possibly scary?"  </p>

<p> "If you do not want to hang outside, you don't have to. But leave us in
peace" scolded Rekha. </p>

<p> Sunita sat with other girls inside while Tara and Rekha stood at the door
all the way to VT. </p>

<p> "Do you want to watch a Hindi movie or a English movie, Kala?" asked
Tara. </p>

<p> "I do not know. Whatever you people decide is fine" said Kala. </p>

<p> "No, you decide. You are the birthday girl" said Rekha. </p>

<p> "Let us watch an English movie. Since we are going all the way to VT
that might be a good idea. We could have easily watched a Hindi movie
anywhere else. But English movies are played mostly only in town" said
Kala. </p>

<p> "That is a good idea" said Rekha. "I hope we might be able to get some
tickets. Otherwise we will have to buy tickets in black."  </p>

<p> "Yes, tickets might be difficult with ten of us. We may have to watch
a flop movie" said Tara laughing. </p>

<p> Luckily they got tickets for the movie they wanted to watch. People
always dressed up well for movies. Once the movie started it was all
dark but still people dressed up when they went to movies. It was a
cultural thing to do. After the movie Tara and her friends walked out
of the theater, a little dazed to come back to the real world, rubbing
their eyes. </p>

<p> "That was a good movie" said Kala. "Thank you friends. Now I will
treat you to lunch. Let us go to Kamat's. We can eat some channa
batura (chick peas curry and bread) and they also have some pao bhaji
(potatoes and bread)." </p>

<p> "Sounds good" said Rekha. </p>

<p> After lunch they walked along Worli sea face. They sat on the walls
that lined the sea face. </p>

<p> "I love the sound of the splashing waves" said Tara. "When I sit
here I feel one with nature. My mind goes blank and I am at peace." </p>

<p> "I feel the same" said Kala. </p>

<p> "Me too" said Sunita. </p>

<p> There were many people sitting all along the wall. Worli Sea face was
a place one could see Bombay in its full glory. There were people who
were jobless and hunting for jobs sitting with an expression of
dejection and there were rich ladies, who had parked their cars
nearby, sitting, chatting, and eating bhel (puffed rice with chutneys)
or drinking coconut water. Tara could smell the roasted corn cobs
which was sold with an application of salt, chili powder, and lemon
juice. There were many channawallas around. The rich and the poor ate
the same things. The sellers did not distinguish between the poor or
the rich. They did not get any tips nor did they expect any. </p>

<p> "This is Bombay where the rich and poor walk hand in hand and live
side by side" said Tara. </p>

<p> "Yes" agreed Kala. "On one side we have tall buildings and on the
other people live in small canvas or even plastic huts." </p>

<p> "That they can live thus is a miracle" said Tara. "In other cities
the poor are not allowed to hang around where the rich live."  </p>

<p> "The miracle is corruption" said Sunita laughing. </p>

<p> "It is getting late. Time to head back" said Rekha. </p>

<p> As they walked back they saw a young lady with a little child in her
arms sitting and crying. Her eyes were flooded with tears and she was
sobbing noiselessly. </p>

<p> "This woman is truly sad" said Tara. "She is not crying to get
sympathy. She is crying because her soul is hurt. Let us find out why
she is crying." </p>

<p> "Why are you crying?" Tara asked the lady. </p>

<p> The lady at first did not want to say anything but on second thoughts
found some comfort in finding a listener to her woes. </p>

<p> "I gave birth to another baby girl. I already have two girls.
Everyone is very unhappy with me. They wanted me to have a son. I am
sad that my husband is unhappy." </p>

<p> Tara and her friends listened for sometime and since it was late they
decided to leave. Suddenly Tara had a brain wave and she said </p>

<p> "Since Kala has bought us lunch, I can easily afford to spare at least
twenty rupees. I am going to give it to that lady."  </p>

<p> "I can do that too" said  Rekha.  </p>

<p> Now all the ten girls decided to donate twenty rupees each. They
collected the money and gave it to the lady.  </p>

<p> "We want you to buy yourself a present since you have a new baby" said
Tara.  </p>

<p> This made the lady smile.  </p>

<p> "I do not need the money" she said. "You are right girls. I should
be happy that I have a gift of a child. I do not care what my husband
thinks. I do not care what anybody thinks. I should be happy."  </p>

<p> The lady then showered kisses on the child in her arms.  </p>

<p> "The reason why some Indian parents are unhappy when a girl child is
born is mainly dowry" said Tara. "Otherwise bringing up a boy or a
girl costs the same."  </p>

<p> "But if you have a son then he is a comfort for the parents in their
old age" said Sunita.  </p>

<p> "Yes, that should probably make them happier if a son is born" said
Tara.  "That reason alone would not make them unhappy if a girl is
born. It is dowry that makes the birth of a girl an unhappy event in
certain homes."  </p>

<p> "You are right Tara" said Rekha. "I  vow that I will not give dowry
if and when I marry." </p>

<p> All the girls made a promise that day that they would not give dowry. 
The lady listening to all this was empowered and she said </p>

<p> "I am lucky to meet you girls. I am somehow changed." </p>

<p> "Be nice to your daughter" said Rekha. "She will turn out like you."  </p>

<p> "True. My daughter will be like me" said the lady
smiling. </p>

<p> The lady did not take the money from the girls but thanked them for
showing her the light. Tara and her friends then took the train back
home. </p>

<p> "Let us sit on the floor instead of the seats" said Rekha. </p>

<p> "That will be fun" said Tara. "It is a little dirty though." </p>

<p> Tara and some of her friends sat near the entrance of the train. There
was a cool wind blowing. </p>

<p> "Such a nice quiet night" said Tara. "Look at the stars. It looks
straight out of a greeting card."  </p>

<p> "Yes. It is a beautiful night" said Rekha. </p>

<p> "Thank you for making my birthday so much fun" said Kala at the end of
the trip. </p>

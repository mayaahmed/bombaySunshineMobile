<h3> Chapter 41  </h3>
<h2>Someone special </h2>


<p> Tara was looking forward to her trip to the Center for Advancement of
Rural Technology since Sarita had such a high regard for the place.
Tara had to be ready by five in the morning and go to a bus stop
where the rest of the group was waiting. </p>

<p> "The worst part of the trip is waking up so early" said Tara to Dharam. </p>

<p> "Tara, meet the rest of the group" said Dharam. </p>

<p> "Hi, I am Deepak" said Deepak. </p>

<p> "I am Tara" said Tara. </p>

<p> "Hi, I am Arjun" said Arjun. "I did not get your name. What is it
again?"  </p>

<p> "I am Tara" said Tara. </p>

<p> More people came and the introduction rounds continued. </p>

<p> "Everyone is here. We should walk to the Kanjur station" said Dharam. </p>

<p> The train trip to Karjat was interesting and everyone in the group
explained how or why they were interested in rural
development. Sometimes conversations were about books they read and
they thought others should read.  At other times it was about corruption
and politics. Tara really liked this crowd of people. She found the
conversations interesting. The three hours spend in the train to
Karjat was a learning experience for Tara. When they reached their
destination, Tara was thrilled. The center was surrounded by farms all
around. </p>

<p> "This surely is a place I will like to work in. It is beautiful" said Tara
to Lata. </p>

<p> The girls were given a room to stay. Coconuts and sacks of grains
surrounded the room. </p>

<p> "I am scared there might be mice around" said Lata. </p>

<p>  The thought scared Tara. </p>

<p>   "Are there any mice here?" asked Tara to the caretaker woman who was
helping the girls settle down. </p>

<p>  "Yes, but they do not bother people. Snakes are more troublesome" said
the woman. </p>

<p> "Are there snakes around?" asked Lata. </p>

<p> "Not always" said the woman. "But sometimes they do come in."  </p>

<p> Poor Lata spend the next half hour looking through the coconuts,
the sacks, and the curtains to see if there were any snakes around. </p>

<p> "You better get some sleep, Lata. We have to wake up early again tomorrow"
said Tara. </p>

<p> "I do not think I will sleep a wink tonight. If I sleep I may sleep
forever" said Lata. </p>

<p> Tara shut her eyes and laughed softly at Lata's fears.</p>

<p> The next couple of days were busy. The whole group was divided in to
smaller teams involving different activities. Some people studied
traditional medicine, others explored new technologies for rural
areas, some people build structures for the center, and so on.  Tara
was a part of a team that went on outdoor surveys and she came back
only late in the evening. The group sat around on the floor for a
simple dinner cooked by the caretaker and they talked about what they
did in the day. On the last day of the trip Dharam said </p>

<p> "We have all worked so hard. Let us relax a little. Let us go to the nearby
lake after dinner and just talk." </p>

<p> Everyone agreed and the evening passed quickly with people singing songs
and telling jokes. When they got back to the center, Tara felt like having
tea. </p>

<p> "I wish I could have some tea" Tara said to the next person beside her
and it was Arjun. </p>

<p> "We can make some tea. I would like some tea too" said Arjun. </p>

<p> Dharam overheard this little discussion and he said </p>

 <p> "Sorry, this is against camp rules. You can have tea only in the
morning." </p>

<p> "That is a silly rule. I do not agree to it" said Tara.  </p>

<p> "Why can't we have tea? What has morning or evening got to do with it?" 
asked Arjun.  </p>

<p> "That is a rule. Rules have to be obeyed" said Dharam. </p>

<p> "That is a silly rule" said  Tara again. </p>

<p> "After Dharam goes to sleep, we can make some tea" whispered Arjun.
"We will just sit and chat for a while till then." </p>

<p> "Great" said Tara really happy about doing something naughty. </p>

<p> Tara and Arjun sat down under a tree and they began to talk.  Arjun
had a lot to say about the education system of India and how it could
be improved. </p>

<p> "I wish I had a serious opinion like that to talk about. I will
instead tell you a joke" said Tara and told a joke. </p>

<p> Tara thought that she had to say something. She had not formed an opinion
about the Indian education system yet. Jokes were all that she had to
offer. </p>

<p> "I really am sorry I am being incongruous to the conversation" said Tara. </p>

<p> "Honestly, we like your jokes" said Arjun. A few other people had also
joined Tara and Arjun. Every one talked about the problems with the
school system in India. Time flew and soon it was morning. </p>

<p> "It seems like we do not have to break any rules, Tara. We can now
officially make tea" said Arjun. </p>

<p> "We sure can" said Tara. </p>

<p> Arjun made a fire and put the kettle on and made tea for the whole
group. </p>

<p> "Dharam, because of your silly rule we did have some interesting
conversations last night" said Arjun. </p>

<p>  "Rules are always good. Follow rules and it will get you somewhere" said
Dharam laughing. </p>

<p>  On the way  back Arjun  sat beside  Tara in  the train.
There was an expert on  Indian birds sitting near and he was
telling them about  what were the good places  in the campus
to watch  birds. Tara looked out  of the train  and some saw
pretty green birds sitting on the telegraph poles. From time
to time they would jump  to catch something in the air. Tara
asked the expert </p>

<p> "What are those birds?" </p>

<p> "Oh, they are bee eaters. They are quite common. You see a lot of them
in the campus" said the expert. </p>

<p> "Are you interested in birds?" asked Arjun. </p>

<p> "A little" said Tara.</p>

<p> "We must keep in touch, We have a lot in common" said Arjun. </p>

<p> "Sure we should" said Tara. </p>

<p> Tara liked the entire group of people who went with her on this
trip. They were serious minded people and she had no trouble
connecting to them. She might have stayed in touch with Arjun. But
Arjun was taking no chances. He met her the very next day. He walked
back with her from her department towards her hostel.  He identified the
names of butterflies they saw as they walked along. </p>
 

<p> "Common egg fly, Common tiger, Common crow, Common cabbage. Look at the
names people have given to butterflies. It does not do justice to these
pretty things" said Tara. </p>

<p> "I agree the names are not very pretty but it is easy to remember"
said Arjun. "A common cabbage has feathers the color of a cabbage
and a common leopard has feathers that look like leopard skin and so
on." </p>

<p> Arjun also seemed to know the name of all the trees on the way. </p>

<p> "That tree is called copper pod" said Arjun pointing to a big tree on
the side of the road. </p>

<p> "Why is it called copper pod?" asked Tara. </p>

<p> "Because it has yellow flowers."  </p>

<p> "I always liked the yellow flowers of this tree scattered on the black
road. I did not know the name of this tree before." </p>

<p> "That tree is a rain tree. Every evening the leaves droop and go to
sleep. Rain trees are pretty common."  </p>

<p> "I never noticed that the leaves drooped. All this is so good to know." </p>

<p> "Come with me to Dongri. There is plenty of wildlife there. Come let
us go." </p>

<p> "Well, I do not know."  </p>

<p> Tara was a little hesitant. </p>

<p> "Come, let us go. You will really like that place." </p>

<p> Tara did not understand why she felt so comfortable with Arjun like
 she felt with no other man before. She felt she could trust Arjun and
 she decided to go with him to Dongri. </p>

<p> "Where is Dongri?" asked Tara. </p>

<p> "It is just behind Pod lake. We can walk to it from here" said Arjun
 pointing to a narrow road behind  the hostels and it seemed to go
 away from the campus. </p>

<p>"Okay, I might as well come along and see Dongri" said Tara following
Arjun into the woods. </p>

<p>Arjun picked up a stick from the ground and moved the shrubs apart so
that Tara could walk through. </p>

<p>"This is wonderful" said Tara. "I never thought that there was such
a beautiful place this  close to where I live. You know, none of
my girl friends would dare take a walk in these woods. I am glad I met
you."  </p>

<p> "Look. The King Cobra himself" said Arjun pointing to the majestic
snake on the ground before them. </p>

<p> The snake looked at Tara and Arjun for a second and it moved away slowly.  </p>

<p> "Cool" said Tara.  </p>

<p> "There are lots of snakes here. There is even a leopard roaming
around. So one has to be a little careful."   </p>

<p> "Yes, I heard about it. Have you seen the leopard?"  </p>

<p> "No. But some of my friends have seen it. It is a cub and it eats
stray dogs. It escaped from the national park. People encroached on
the leopard's space and now the leopard encroaches on ours."  </p>


<p> Tara and Arjun walked on till they came to something that looked like
an abandoned shed.  </p>

<p> "This is called the boat house" said Arjun. "A few years back boating
was an active sport of the students of this campus. Nowadays no one
goes boating but people come here during moonlit nights to study
stars."   </p>

<p> "It must be scary with all these snakes and leopards."  </p>

<p>"No. As long as you do not step on snakes they leave you alone. Most
animals attack humans only for self defense."   </p>

<p> "I guess humans are the scariest of all wild animals" said Tara laughing.  </p>

<p> Tara walked on and she saw a lot of mango trees and she plucked a few
raw mangoes and ate them. She collected a few in her hands.  </p>

<p> "You can put the mangoes in this bag" said Arjun taking out a plastic
bag from the bag he was carrying on his shoulders.  </p>

<p> "Thanks. I will give these to my friends in the hostel. They will be
thrilled. I will bring them along here someday. Now let us head back."  </p>


<p> "Let us go a little further."   </p>

<p> Arjun was unwilling to put an end to the walk. So they walked some
more till they came to a spot full of palm trees. </p>

<p> "Look at all those palm nuts on the ground" said Tara. "We could
break them up and eat tadgolas." </p>

<p> "No. These nuts are no good. They are too tough and not edible." </p>

<p> "What do you mean?" asked Tara.</p>

<p> "Wait I will show you" said Arjun. </p>

<p>  He then took out a pen knife from his bag and he cut open a palm nut
 and showed Tara. </p>

<p> "Yes, the tadgolas are like rocks" said Tara. "I never knew they
 became like that.  That is cool. None of my girlfriends would carry a
 pen knife and would think of opening up a palm nut like that. I guess
 it must be fun to be a man." </p>

<p> "I am not complaining. But women have their charms too" said Arjun.  </p>

<p> Tara had sat on a rock to inspect the palm nuts and Arjun was sitting
besides her on another rock. Tara found a stick and she began playing
with the palm nuts by  pushing them around.  </p>

<p> "This reminds me of my native village" said Tara. "We used to pluck
mangoes and guavas and eat straight from the tree. In Bombay we have
to buy everything."   </p>

<p> She soon found herself talking about her family and answering personal
questions  quite easily to her own surprise. </p>

<p> "It was fun going for a walk with you. I am going to take all my
friends to the place I saw today" said Tara when they reached her
hostel. </p>

<p> "I am glad you liked these places. Tomorrow we can to Shahenshah" said
Arjun. </p>

<p> "Where is Shahenshah?" asked Tara. </p>

<p> "It is a little village of fishermen. In the evenings they drink country
liquor, play drums, and sing songs."  </p>

<p> "That should be a fun place to see. I would like to go. But do you have the
time?" </p>


<p> "Yes, I am a little free these days."  </p>

<p> Arjun took his leave. After he left, Tara was uncomfortable about
agreeing to go to Shahenshah. Next minute she forgot the feeling.
She decided Arjun was going to be a good friend of hers and she would
have lots of fun times with him. </p>

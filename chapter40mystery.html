<h3> Chapter 40  </h3>
<h2>Mystery solved </h2>

<p> Though Tara was not nosy, Seeta's hint dropping was getting on her
nerves. Seeta was one of Tara's oldest friends and it was annoying
that she was keeping secrets from her. On top of that she was always
dropping hints about something that was going on in her life. As they
stood on the terrace enjoying the evening breeze Seeta was humming a
Hindi song </p>

<p> "Goonghat ki aad se dilbar ka,
deedar adoora rahta hain,
Jab tak na pade aashiq ki nazar,
shringar adoora rahta hain.
(From behind a veil, the vision
of your lover is incomplete,
till your lover's eyes rest on you,
your shringar is incomplete)." </p>

<p> "It is kind of strange that all our exposure to Indian poetry is these
Hindi movie songs that we deride so much" said Tara. "On the one
hand these movie songs are considered low brow and yet these songs are
an integral part of our psyche. Nothing expresses our thoughts more
clearly than the tunes that we hum." </p>

<p> "You have a point there" said Seeta. "Remember the poem we learned in
school about Daffodils. It made no sense to me. Recently I saw
pictures of daffodils and I now can understand why somebody would want
to write a poem on daffodils since they are so pretty. When I learned
that poem it meant nothing to me and I could not understand why the
teacher praised that poem so much." </p>

<p> "Yes, all the poems we learn were in English written about a foreign land
and for a foreign audience. That is the problem with an English education.
It steals a lot of our own culture from us." </p>

<p> "But it is scientific. It gives us a cutting edge in studying science and
we always have our Hindi songs, don't we?" </p>

<p> "Think about it. There are no words really for Shringar in English.
Make up or decorations sound stupid. Shringar is such an Indian
concept.  We know that there are sixteen shringars for a woman. It is
so much in sync in a Hindi song and means nothing in its English
counterpart." </p>


<p> "And yet we know no other language better than English to express our
thoughts. We are seriously handicapped in languages." </p>

<p> "Yes, we know what shringar means but there are so many other such
words that we do not know since we never learned them and thereby so
many concepts." </p>

<p> Just then Tara's little brother Chintu and his friends surfaced on the
terrace and they had a couple of slippers in their hands. Tara saw
Chintu throwing the slippers really far away with great force. </p>

<p> "What did you do just now?" asked Tara. </p>

<p> "I threw Seema Akka's chappals away" said Chintu laughing. </p>

<p> "Did you notice that the chappals were from different pairs? So now
Seema Akka will have one chappal of each pair" said Mani. </p>

<p> "Why would you do that for? That is a silly thing to do" said Tara
scolding her brother dutifully as an elder sister but hiding a smile.
Seeta was openly laughing. </p>

<p> "That lady deserves that. Now she will create a ruckus" said Seeta. </p>

<p> "That is not all. There is more" said Mani. He could not finish for he
was laughing hard. So Dabba continued the story telling. </p>

<p> "We wrote 420 in big letters in front of her door. And we made an arrow
pointing to her house." </p>

 <p> The 420 law was a law for punishing cheats and it was considered a
 major insult to  call someone 420 in Bombay. </p>

<p> "Why would you do that?" asked Tara. </p>

<p> "Yesterday we were playing cricket on the street as usual" said
  Dabba. "Seema Akka had to pass that way and the ball hit
  her. She came and broke our bat and stems and called us a lot of bad
  names. So now this is our revenge."  </p>

<p> "There is more" said Mani laughing. </p>

<p> "What? Writing 420 on the wall was not enough revenge for you people?
There is more?" asked Tara. </p>

<p> "We collected all the garlands the flower seller dropped today and
garlanded the 420" said Mani. </p>

<p> The flower sellers of Bombay dropped flower garlands on a daily basis
outside the doors of some houses who asked for it. These flowers were
mostly used for religious purposes. </p>

<p> "This is going to be a tough one. I guess we need to take cover" said
Tara. </p>

<p> So Tara and the kids gathered up in a room in Mani's house waiting for
Seema Akka to discover the garlands, the 420, and the missing slippers. </p>

<p> "Ayyo! Who did this? Who wrote 420 on my wall? Ayyo!" said Seema Akka
bringing forth roars of laughter from the room in Mani's house. </p>

<p> "Ayyo, Who put these flower garlands on the 420? Ayyo, where are my
slippers?" asked Seema Akka. </p>

<p> It so happened that Dabba's dad happened to pass by and Seema Akka
in her confusion asked him </p>

<p> "Did you put these garlands on my wall?" </p>

<p> "What am I mad?" asked Dabba's father completely surprised. </p>

<p> "Ayyo, I don't know who but somebody wrote 420 and hid my slippers" said
Seema Akka. </p>

<p> Well not many people knew who hid Seema Akka's slippers and the few
who did were not going to tell. </p>

<p> "Revenge is sweet" said Mani only to be greeted with roars of
laughter. </p>

<p> Seeta seemed preoccupied again after the commotion. Tara was getting
concerned about Seeta. </p>

<p> "Who is this person?" asked Tara. </p>

<p> "I cannot tell you now, I need to be sure" said Seeta.  </p>

<p> "Whoever he is, I am sure he is not worth this turbulence of emotions.
Get over it and be yourself again" said Tara.  </p>

<p> "It is not so easy" said Seeta.  </p>

<p> "Why not? Look at Raji. She is happy and Mandar is nowhere in her
life now" said Tara.  </p>

<p> "I know your theory about love being ephemeral. But when it exists, it
bothers you and that's true" said Seeta laughing. "Tara, the problem is
that it is all wrong and yet feels so right.  That is why I am so
reluctant."  </p>

<p> "Why does it feel wrong? I am not prying or anything. But one cannot
converse without the full details" said Tara.  </p>

<p> "Our culture, our society, and our family are unforgiving units.  A
girl has to tread a path of romance really carefully. It is better she
avoids romance all together" said Seeta.  </p>

<p> "I agree. It is tough. Stick to the safe roads" said Tara still clueless
about what Seeta was talking about.   </p>

<p> Seeta sighed and recited <br/>

"A few stolen moments, <br/>

to bask in your presence, <br/>

to see the shades of joy, <br/>

dancing in your eyes, <br/>

that is what life has chosen, <br/>

to give me as treasures."   </p>

<p> "Just get over it" said Tara angrily. "Will you?"  </p>

But as days passed, Seeta did not talk much about the secret in her
life. Moreover Tara had to return to her hostel for the new semester.  </p>

<p> One day Tara's hostel manager said  </p>

<p> "Your mother called. She asked you to call up immediately. It concerns
some friend of yours called Seeta."  </p>

<p> Tara quickly went and called up her mother to find out what happened.  </p>

<p> "Tara, Seeta has left the country. Did she tell you anything? She just
left home in the middle of the night. She left a letter behind saying
that she was married to Mohan and that she was flying to Dubai."  </p>

<p> "Mohan? Did she marry Mohan? Mohan  who works in Dubai? Gee! We have
known him as kids. I saw him a couple of days back. He was here on
a vacation and we were talking about life in Dubai. Well, Seeta did
not tell me anything about it."   </p>


<p> "Seeta's family wanted to talk to you. They thought you might know
something since you were her best friend."  </p>


<p> "I do not know anything, Ma. Seeta did not tell me anything." </p>

<p> "Seeta's mother has had a heart attack. She is hospitalized." </p>

<p> "I will come home right away."  </p>

<p> Tara visited Seeta's mother in the hospital. Seeta's mother was crying
all the time. </p>

<p> "Don't get her excited. Patient needs rest" said the nurse. </p>

<p> Later Tara  asked her mother </p>

<p> "Is it true Seeta's mother got a heart attack because Seeta married
Mohan? It might just be a coincidence and may have nothing to do with what
Seeta did." </p>

<p> "Her mother is such a proud lady" said Tara's mother. "It is
possible she could not deal with the shock. Children should not behave
like that." </p>

<p> Tara became defensive about her friend. </p> 

<p> "Seeta's mother would have never let her marry Mohan. That is why she
had to take such a drastic step." </p>


<p> "Parents always want the best for their children. Seeta should have thought
what her actions would mean to her mother." </p>

<p> "Seeta, I know loved her mother dearly. I am sure she will be sad when she
hears of her mother's illness." </p>

<p> "She appeared to be such a simple girl. I would have never thought she
would have the guts to do this. She made the visa and passport
herself. She even bought the plane tickets on her own. That girl
looked so simple. It is impossible to believe she did something like
this." </p>

<p> A few  days later Seeta's mother died and Tara felt very bad
for Seeta. Tara went looking for  Sarita. </p>

<p> "Sarita, I do not know what Seeta will do when she hears of her mother's
death. I think this will affect her whole life. She will never be able
to get rid of this guilt. Was her love for Mohan so important that she
had to cause so much misery for everyone?"  </p>

<p> "Seeta must not have anticipated such a turn of events" said
Sarita. "This you must agree is an extreme case." </p>

<p> "I am sure I will never do anything stupid like that" said Tara.
"Only arranged marriage for me. One man is good as the other. All
married couples compromise so what is the point in being so particular
about who your spouse is?" </p>

<p> "When your time comes, we shall see" said Sarita laughing. </p>

<p> "Is the place you found for me to work in called Center for
Advancement of Rural Technology?" asked Tara. "I am going there this
weekend." </p>

<p> "Yes" said Sarita. "That is the place. I did not want to tell you
about it before you finished all your exams." </p>

<p> "I am going there with a group of students from our University" said
Tara. "I will check the place out and see whether it suits me to work
there in the future."</p>

<p> "I know you will like it, Tara. Have a nice trip" said Sarita.</p>

<h3> Chapter 24  </h3>
<h2>The Dahi hundi </h2>

<p> Tara suddenly saw Manoj's face outside her window and she screamed in
fright. </p>

<p> "It is only me"said Manoj. "Why are you screaming?  You gave me
such a fright.  A fall from this floor means certain death. I am
hanging up the Dahi hundi (pot of curds)." </p>

<p> Manoj and a few other boys tied the dahi hundi and several rupee notes
on a rope decorated with flower garlands, fruits, and beetle
leaves. They hung it high with one end tied to an iron rod attached to
Tara's window and the other to a rod attached to an opposite flat's
window. The pot hung thus in suspension high up in the air. </p>


<p> "I forgot it was the Gokulashtami festival tomorrow" said  Tara. </p>

<p> Gokulashtami was a festival to celebrate God Krishna's
birthday. Krishna as a child used to break pots to eat makkan (white
butter). Therefore people hung up the dahi hundi for Govindas to
break. The Govindas were a group of young boys who went from one
building to the other and  formed human pyramids to break the dahi
hundi.  Then they would collect the money tied on the decorated rope
as prize. The fruits would be cut up and distributed among the
audience as prasad. </p>

<p> "Isn't it kind of too high?  Will the Govindas be able to get to it?"
asked Tara. </p>

<p> "We have collected five hundred rupees this time"said Manoj. "That
is a lot of money. Hence we are making it more challenging for the
Govindas this time." </p>

<p> The next day morning the loudspeakers blared Hindi movie songs and
there was a festive mood in the air. People kept watch for the
Govindas to arrive. Tara and her friends stood all morning on the
common veranda. </p>

<p> Many groups of Govindas came to Tara's building all morning.  They
always arrived amidst drum beats, singing, dancing, and a lot of
yelling.  The Govindas invariably sang "Govinda ala re (which meant
Govinda is here in Marathi)." </p>

<p> But most of the groups looked at the pot and decided to give it a
miss because it was hung too high. Some groups attempted to reach the
dahi hundi but failed and went away. When finally a particularly large
group of Govindas turned up Tara said </p>

<p> "I think this group will succeed."  </p>

<p> "That guy in a black shirt is the main Govinda" said Seeta. </p>

<p> The guy in the black shirt looked around and his eyes rested on Tara
and her friends. He gave a little salute, a slight smile, and then
bounced around like a sports star. </p>

<p>  "I think he is the main Govinda too"said Tara. "He acts like the hero of
the day." </p>

<p> In a short while the group of boys formed a very tall human
pyramid. People threw buckets of colored water on them. The idea was
to make it as difficult as possible for the Govindas to break the
pot. They fell down a few times and finally the main Govinda climbed
high and broke the pot of curds with a stick. Then the rope was
lowered and the Govindas collected the money. As they left the main
Govinda gave another salute to Tara and her friends. </p>

<p>  "I guess he thinks can afford to salute girls and get away with it in
front of so many people today since he broke the dahi hundi" said
Seeta. </p>

<p>  "He is a daredevil" said Tara. "I am sure that is his style about
everything in life." </p>

<p>  "You flipped for him?" asked Seeta. </p>

<p>  "Just for his courage" said Tara laughing. </p>

<p>  "I like the tongue in cheek aspect about this festival" said Seeta. </p>



<p>  As pots of curds broke around the city of Bombay in celebration of a
festival poor people were losing their dwellings quite close to Tara's
house. The Municipality was clearing the huts which bordered the
colony maidan. When Tara heard about it she and her friends went to
the terrace to watch. A crowd had already gathered on the terrace. </p>

<p>  "Good thing they are breaking the huts"said Seema Akka
loudly. "That maidan is for children to play in. Those huts are
brewing centers for all social evil."  </p>

<p>  "Where was the police when they first build these huts illegally?''
asked Seeta.  "These huts have been here forever now. What is the
use? They will build it again tomorrow. All this is just fooling the
public." </p>

<p>  Tara saw Sarita among the crowd of slum dwellers . She was helping the
slum dwellers salvage whatever they could before the bulldozers razed
their little homes. Sarita was talking to the Municipality workers and
bargaining for time for the slum dwellers. Tara and her friends went
and hung around Sarita. </p>

<p>  "Be quick." shouted a municipality worker. "In ten minutes we will
start the bulldozer." </p>

<p>  Tara saw the slum dwellers gather up their belongings and putting it a
little away from their huts. After some time the huts were razed to
the ground. Tara saw some women crying silently. The poor people were
clearly depressed. Their hard earned money razed to the ground. But
they had no where to go. They waited and watched and shortly after the
bulldozers left they started making their little huts again with
whatever material they could use. </p>

<p> "What is the point?"asked Tara. "Is this a sensible thing to do. I
know we do not like our maidans to be bordered by huts. Either they
should not let the first hut come up there or they should not do
this. I do not understand. Is this the solution society has come up
with to combat poverty? I do not understand." </p>

<p> "The reason we have to break these huts is that otherwise these
structures will become permanent" said Sarita. "The rich will take
over with the prices of land so high in Bombay. At the same time the
society has a heart which will not shoot poor people to death nor does
it want them to go homeless. So somewhere this is a compromise." </p>

<p> "Do you think that this is the best solution?" asked Seeta. </p>

<p> "In this game there are no good solutions" said Sarita. "None that I
know of yet. All we can do is try to help as much as we can in the way
we know best." </p>


<p> Late in the evening when Tara went to the terrace she saw the poor
people were all settled again. She could see the smoke that came from
the firewood the poor women used to cook their dinner. </p>

<p> Tara wrote down in her diary </p>

<p> "That smoke that emanates from the slums signifies the continuation
of the drama of life. Till the end, it is going to be like this. A lot of
churning of emotions and wringings of the heart and also a lot of mindless
laughter at times. But each day goes to the next unrelenting in the most
mundane fashion no matter what happens each day till the life's end." </p>

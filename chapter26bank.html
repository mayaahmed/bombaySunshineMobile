<h3> Chapter 26  </h3>
<h2> Tara's summer job </h2>

<p> Tara had applied for a summer job as a student trainee at a bank.  She
was very happy when she got selected for the job.  On the  first
day of her summer job she tied her hair up in a bun to look more grown
up.  Her mother looked at her with pride in her eyes. </p>

<p> "I am going to work for the first time in my life for an actual
salary" said Tara.  "I have thousands of plans with the money I
make." </p>

<p> "Tara, it is only a stipend. How can you make thousands of plan with so
little?" asked her mother. </p>

<p>  "There is no reason why there should be a limit to making plans"
said Tara.  "Of course executing those plans may not be possible. Let
us not curtail dreams. Dreams are the only things that are free in
this world and let them stay so." </p>

<p> Tara's mother beamed with pride as Tara set out of the house. When
Tara reached the bank, she went to the counter and the clerk looked up
at her and asked </p>

<p> "Do you want to make a deposit?"  </p>

<p> "No" said Tara. "I am a student trainee. I have come here to work." </p>

<p> "Oh, come on in then" said the clerk with a smile. He then  shouted </p>

<p> "Hey, Madam. There is a student trainee here for you." </p>

<p>  The lady who the clerk called madam was a manager. She was scolding
some employees.  When Tara saw this she was a little frightened of
the manager. </p>

<p>  "That woman is a terror" said the clerk looking at Tara's
frightened face. "But do not worry.  You will not have to work
with her for long. You just meet her."  </p>

<p>  Soon Tara was given a desk of her own and there were a few files in
front of her. The pages inside the files contained many columns of
numbers and it was Tara's job to calculate the totals of each column. </p>

<p>  "Is there a calculator around?" asked Tara. </p>

<p>  "Are you in college?" asked the manager. </p>

<p> "Yes." </p>

<p> "And you want a calculator to add? See these people around you? They
have not even passed their twelfth standard and they can add without
a calculator. Why can't you?" </p>

<p> "Well, I thought it just might be easier." </p>

<p> "If you cannot add easily then you might as well give up and go
home." </p>

<p> Tara got angry and she wanted to walk out of the door. But just in
time the clerk interfered and said </p>

<p> "You will not need a calculator. The additions are easy." </p>

<p> "Okay" said Tara still a little angry with the woman. </p>

<p> After some time a little boy came and kept  half a cup of tea in front of
Tara and said </p>

<p> "Cutting (a half cup of tea  was called cutting)." </p>

<p> Tara looked up in surprise. The boy said </p>


<p> "All bank employees get free cuttings twice a day. I am the chaiwallah  (Tea
seller)." </p>

<p> Tara took the cup of tea and drank it. It made her feel better. She
was tired after turning so many pages, totaling, and checking again
and again for errors. She had the reputation of her education at
stake. She was afraid that the lady would find faults with her
calculations. Whenever Tara looked up at the lady, the lady made an
expression of disdain. That was her style. She would make angry faces
at everyone and poor Tara was at a loss how to behave. </p>

<p> Well that was Tara's first day at work and when she got home she was so
tired that she went to sleep without eating her supper. </p>

<p>  "Hey, it is a bank job" exclaimed Tara's mother. "How come you are
so tired child?" </p>

<p> "Bending down and turning pages and totaling is tiring  if one
has to do that for eight hours in a row" said Tara. </p>

<p> "Don't go if you don't want to" said Tara's mother. </p>

<p> "If others can do it, I can do it too" said Tara. </p>

<p> But soon Tara found out why others were not tired at the end of the
day. They took long tea breaks every hour. Some people would act as if
they were working but would actually be sleeping behind their
files. But it seemed like they had sensors that could tell where the
boss was. As soon as a supervisor surfaced a sleeping clerk would wake
up immediately and act as though he was immersed in work.  All this
would tickle Tara's humor and she would think about some people and
laugh all the way home. There were a couple of other student trainees
and Tara became good friends with them. </p>

<p> "That manager really frowns at me" said Tara. "I do not know what
I ever did to her."   </p>

<p> "That is her style. She frowns at me too" said another student trainee. </p>

<p> Other student trainees had the same problem with the manager's frowns. </p>

<p> "Let us teach her a lesson" said Tara. "Let us give her a taste of
her own medicine. I am going to frown at her too the next time she looks
at me. You people do the same."  </p>

<p> This created a lot of mirth among the student trainees. When they got
back to the office after their lunch they set the plan in to
action. Now all the other trainees managed to frown at the manager
quite well but the manager did not find anything amiss. The girls
giggled to themselves.  Tara also wanted to do her part of frowning at
the manager but every time the lady looked at her Tara started
giggling.  This was irritating to the manager and she kept looking at
Tara which made Tara laugh more. </p>

<p> Finally Tara decided to think of some real sad incident in her life
and soon she managed to stop the giggling fit.  Tara then frowned at
the manager in a big way. That was it. Tara burst out laughing and
went to the inside lounge and laughed and laughed. Her friends
followed and they all laughed. After sometime the manager
surfaced. Tara whispered to her friends "She is going to yell and
scream now." </p>

<p> But to everyone's surprise the manager waved and said hello with the
brightest smile ever. </p>

<p> "Talk about surprising behaviors" exclaimed Tara. </p>

<p> Soon Tara had her paycheck and she decided to take her cousin Veena
for a treat. </p>

<p> "Let us go to a five star hotel" said Tara. "After that we will do
some shopping. I need to buy a skirt."  </p>

<p> "Let us go to Taj" said Veena. "We could go and get a couple of soft
drinks and enjoy the ambiance." </p>

<p> Veena went to an up town college. Her friends were mostly fashion
models and Veena knew all about the good life compared to Tara. </p>

<p> "Look, I have a salary" said Tara. "We really can afford to eat
something."  </p>

<p> So they ordered a plate of little pizzas, a few samosas,  a couple
of soft drinks, and in the end even got a pastry each. After all how much
can it cost? Well it took care of all of Tara's salary and Veena
offered to pay part of the bill. </p>

<p> "No. No. This is my treat" said Tara and watched her salary disappear. </p>

<p> "I might as well forget my shopping. But the ambiance was fun" said Tara. </p>

<p> But on their return trip from town, Veena disappeared for a few
minutes to return with a package. When Tara opened the package she
found a beautiful skirt. She exclaimed  </p>

<p> "This was exactly what I wanted. That took care of my shopping.
Thank you Veena." </p>

<p> "All is well that ends well" said Veena. </p>

<p> The next month Tara was very careful with her money. She bought a
ceiling fan for her house. </p>

<p> "Sometimes the most mundane things become so important" said
Tara. "I am so proud that I bought that fan with my pay check. I have
never cared about a fan in my life before. There are so many other
fans in the world but this fan is so special because I bought it." </p>

<p> "Fruits of hard work are sweet" said Tara's mother. </p>

<p> Soon Tara's summer job was ending. Tara had learned a lot at her
job. She also enjoyed her work. Tara's latest assignment was to work at
the customer service desk.  It was her job to give out receipts and
put seals on checks the bank got each day. Tara particularly enjoyed
stamping checks. When she was done with putting a stamp on all the
checks for the day she would practice putting seals on a blank paper.
She wanted her stamps to look perfect all the time. </p>

<p> "The right pressure, the right amount of ink and lo, we get a perfect seal"
said Tara to a neighboring clerk. </p>

<p> "I have never seen anyone so happy working with a stamp" said the
clerk laughing. </p>

<p> "Putting seals on something makes you feel important. For
some reason I like it better than signatures" said Tara. </p>

<p> "Your training is getting over soon. Will you come back to work for
us after your studies?" asked the clerk. </p>

<p>  "I do not know" said Tara. </p>

<p>  "Are you going to give us a farewell party?" asked the clerk.  Tara
gulped remembering how her salary had vanished at the five star hotel
treat she gave her cousin. </p>

<p>  "Do not worry" said the clerk.  We know your stipend is not big. Just
buy us cuttings." </p>

<p>  "That we sure can do" said Tara happily.  She quickly got together
with other student trainees and made arrangements for tea and some
snacks for the office people for the next day. </p>

<p>  "Our bank job gets over tomorrow" said Tara to the student
trainees. "It is at such times that I understand the concept of
illusion or Maya. I came to this place every day for three
months.  I was with these people for three months.  May be after
tomorrow I will not see them ever again. Was this three months real?
Did it matter whether it was real or not?" </p>

<p>  "Poet!" said one student trainee. </p>

<p>  "Philosopher" said another. </p>


<p> The next day the student trainees treated  the office staff with tea
and snacks. The office staff  profusely thanked the students.
When everyone started to go back to their desks to work,  the
manager said </p>

<p> "Wait, wait, wait. We have something for these hard working students."  </p>

<p> She  gave a little speech about how good it had been to have the
student trainees around and she gave each of them a pen set. </p>


<p> When Tara showed her mother the pen set she said </p>

<p> "Keep it carefully. That is a real nice pen set you got."  </p>

<p> That night Tara wrote in her diary </p>

<p> "Everything seems like an illusion. Just like how one wakes up from a
dream and there are a few traces left, this pen set and that circulating
fan are traces of my wonderful dream of a summer job at a bank." </p>

<h3> Chapter 42  </h3>
<h2>Mine and only mine </h2>
        
<p> It became a routine for Arjun to wait for Tara outside her department
and walk back with her towards the hostel. Invariably he would
convince her to go to a new place with him. Today they had walked the
whole length of the Pod lake. Arjun and Tara was sitting besides the
lake watching the sunset. </p>

<p> "It is so quiet and peaceful here" said Tara. "The reflection of the
sunset on the lake is mind blowing. I think I am going to become a
hermit. You know, live in a little hut in a forest. It will be so much
fun." </p>

<p> "We will be able to manage that" said Arjun.  </p>

<p> Tara was a little surprised.  Why was Arjun considering himself part
of Tara's plans of being a hermit?  Tara decided to let go of
that question and went back to watching the sunset. </p>

<p> "Hi Tara" called out Meena from far. </p>

<p> "Hi" said Tara back but Meena did not linger. She just left the place
with a meaningful grin. This was getting to be embarrassing for Tara.
What would Arjun think? He was just a friend. </p>

<p> "Let us get some dinner" said Arjun. </p>

<p> All the restaurants were situated outside the gates of the campus and
Tara and Arjun walked towards the gates. </p>

<p> "This is a good place. The food is good here" said Arjun stopping by
a real small shanty restaurant. </p>

<p> "Really. Does anyone eat here?" asked Tara in surprise. </p>

<p> "Yes, it is a great place" said Arjun and they entered the small
dingy place. </p>

<p> "You know I feel very brave entering this place. None of my girlfriends
would ever think of eating in a place like this." </p>

<p> "Get us a plate of daal (lentils) fry, tomato fry, and some rotis" ordered
Arjun. </p>

<p> "You know, none of my girl friends would order dishes like that at a
restaurant" said Tara. </p>

<p> "What do girls eat?" asked Arjun. </p>

<p> "Chana masala, paneer kofta, or something fancy like that. Ordering
daal fry would never occur to any of us. This is so macho." 

<p> "We eat here all the time."  </p>

<p> Arjun was a little amused by Tara's comments. Tara looked around and
found that she was the only female in the place and a few people were
actually watching her. But she was not afraid. Somehow She knew she
was safe wherever she was if she was with Arjun.  She also enjoyed the
meal Arjun had ordered for them. </p>

<p> "Tomorrow we can go to Koldi. You will really like that place" said Arjun. </p>

<p> Tara thought of Meena's meaningful grin and she realized that she was
spending way too much time with Arjun. This was not right. So she said </p>

<p> "Arjun, may be I am getting addicted to you. Let us keep some distance." </p>

<p> To Tara's surprise Arjun did not like that statement at all. He was
angry and looked hurt. After dinner, instead of walking back to the
hostels he walked towards the woods. </p>

<p> "It is too late to be romping in the forests" said Tara. "There are
snakes and also a leopard. Please let us go back to the hostel." </p>

<p> Tara was  completely at a loss about Arjun's anger. </p>

<p> "I do not care" said Arjun.  </p>

<p> He walked among the tall grass deeper and deeper into the woods and
Tara followed. When they reached the boat house Arjun stopped and he
sat down on the cement floor and Tara sat beside him. </p>

<p> "I am sorry" said Tara. "I do not know what I said to make you
angry." </p>

<p> "You know Tara, I intend to marry you" said Arjun. </p>

<p> Tara was taken aback. It was not like that she was surprised for she
 knew that Arjun was special. It was only a week since she had met him
 and she had spend more time with him than any other man she had
 known. Every day they had romped the woods or gone for walks along
 lake sides. It had been a week long trip of discovering nature for
 Tara. She had enjoyed Arjun's company and yet she had not wanted
 marriage.  It was way too soon. </p>

<p> "Arjun, I do not want to marry" said Tara. "It will interfere with
 my plans. I am sure I will be a lousy wife. I want to travel to
 remote places and marriage will not work for me. Why can't we be just
 good friends?" </p>

<p> "Friends I have plenty. You, I want to marry" said Arjun. </p>

<p> "I do not believe in marriage. I have seen couples fight so
 much. Sometimes I think it is better to have an enemy than a
 spouse. I don't want to marry, Arjun." </p>

<p> "That is not true, Tara. There are really happy couples. A lot of my
 friends are really happily married. I am sure we will be happy
 together. You will be free to do what you want. You can travel,
 explore, and study even after we are married." </p>

<p> "No, not marriage. I have not seen a single ideal couple in my life yet." </p>

<p> "Okay, think about it. I want to marry you and I am sure we will be happy.
Let us go back. It is getting late. There is a full moon up there tonight
luckily. We can avoid stepping on snakes."  </p>

<p> Arjun knew that his proposal had gone well. He had made his point and now
it was just a matter of time. On the way he met some friends and he
introduced Tara to everyone. After they left he said </p>

<p> "Now I can introduce you to people. I did not want any competition before
I proposed to you." </p> 

<p> Tara had to laugh. They did not talk about marriage again when they
met the next day.  Arjun gave Tara a book and said  </p>

<p> "Here is a book for you. It is a children's book called the Little
prince.  Let us say the book's philosophy is my philosophy too. I hope
you like the book." </p>

<p> "What is it about?" asked Tara. </p>

<p> "It is about a prince and his love for a rose. He has a garden and
I have one too. Would you like to see it?" </p>

<p> "Sure" said Tara. </p>

<p> Arjun took her to the backyard of his hostel and said "Welcome to my
garden, Tara." </p>

<p> "Where is your garden?" asked Tara a little surprised. </p>

<p> "You are standing in it. The garden is kind of new and the plants are
small" said Arjun.  </p>

<p>  Tara noticed that the land she was standing on was cleared of weeds
 and there were some small plants growing around. </p>

<p> "This is a Papaya tree. This is a Hibiscus plant" said Arjun pointing
them to Tara. </p>

<p> "You need to put up a sign board. It is hard to tell it is
a garden" said Tara laughing. </p>

<p> "Every man should have a garden. It is good for the soul. Voltaire says that
in Candida too." </p>

<p> "I guess it must be fun to have a garden." </p>

<p> Tara was a little intrigued by Arjun and his ways. He was rich and
intelligent and yet so simple. So different from most boys she had
known before. He was also easy to get along with.  </p>

<p> A couple of days later Tara felt like looking pretty. She looked through
her wardrobe and she picked out a yellow sari. </p>

<p> "I have a boyfriend now. I can afford to look pretty" said Tara to Mala. </p>

<p> Tara knew she looked good but she had not expected the effect it would
have on Arjun. He was really  thrilled. </p>

<p> "You look incredible, Tara. I have never seen anyone look so good in
a sari before" said Arjun. </p>

<p> "I just felt like dressing up a little today" said Tara with a grin. </p>

<p> "You look incredible" said Arjun again. </p>

<p> The two of them walked towards a pond Tara called  their pond. They had
spend every afternoon besides that pond for a week now. </p>

<p>"I wonder why people do not take time off to sit besides a pond like
this" said Tara.  "Look at the beauty nature has to offer us. The
butterflies, the flowers, the songs of the birds. Yet, man has no
time. All other living beings spend time appreciating nature and her
seasonal gifts except people." </p>

<p> A minute later Arjun had taken Tara's hand in his hand and tied a little
rope he had made of grass around her finger and he said </p>

<p> "Tara, we are engaged." </p>

<p> It was too nice a moment to say anything. </p>

<p> "We are engaged?" asked Tara softly after sometime. </p>

<p> "Yes, I will get you another ring soon. But this rope ring
will do for now" said Arjun. </p>

<p> "Engagements are a big thing in my family" said Tara.  "Lots of
people come over and there is usually a big party. This is surely
a quaint way of getting engaged." </p>

<p> "We must meet each others family soon" said Arjun. </p>

<p> "I need to break this news  to my mother. It is going to be tough since
we are not from the same religion. My father might ship me off to a village
or something. I am worried" said Tara. </p>

<p> "They will never be able to do that. I am a tough guy" said Arjun. </p>

<p> The meeting with the families were not smooth but Tara and Arjun had
handled it well. As days went by they found it harder and harder to stay
away from each other.  </p>

<p> Tara's friends excused her for staying away from many major
events. But for an important function in her department she decided to
stay and help. She was busy the entire day. </p>

<p> "Tara, let us go for a walk" said Arjun.   </p>

<p> "No, Arjun" said Tara. "I cannot leave now. What will my friends
think? I need to help out. It is my duty. I will be busy all day." </p>

<p>"I will be back in one hour" said Arjun and he was back after
half hour.   </p>

<p> "Tara, you may as well leave. Arjun is not going to let you do any
work" said Mala laughing.  </p>

<p> "Arjun, you are impossible. Don't you see I have work to do? What will
my friends think?" asked Tara.  </p>

<p> "I do not care. I cannot stay away from you for so long" said Arjun.  </p>

<p> So Tara excused herself from the jobs assigned to her and left with
Arjun. After all nothing or no one mattered more to her than Arjun anymore.  </p>

<p> Time and again Tara's life before Arjun resurfaced and started making
demands on her time. It was a growing conflict she could not ignore. </p>

<p> "Tara, please participate in the Performing Arts festival with
us. Please, please" said Monika who was a junior. </p>

<p> "I cannot" said Tara. "I do not have the time. Anyways it is for
juniors. We did our parts last year. Now you people do yours." </p>

<p> "But we need enthusiastic people like you" said Monika. </p>

<p> "No. I do not have time" said Tara escaping from the little crowd
of juniors around her. </p>

<p> "They want me to participate in the Performing Arts festival. I said
no" explained Tara to Arjun. </p>

<p> "Good. All that is a waste of time" said Arjun. </p>

<p> "Being on Stage is an interesting feeling. I just did not want to get
involved this year, that is all. I would rather spend the time with
you" said Tara smiling. </p>

<p> But a few days later the juniors had surrounded Tara again. </p>

<p>"Tara, do not act in the play. But we want you to be part of the
advertising campaign. This will take no time. You just have to dress
up as an angel and stand on top of a high stage. You can do this much
for the hostel" said Monika. </p>

<p> "Okay" said Tara hesitantly. </p>

<p> "It is tonight. It will only take an hour of your time. Thanks a lot"
said Monika really happy. </p>

<p> That night Tara dressed up as an angel. She wore a flowing white robe
and let her hair loose. Arjun and Tara waited outside the auditorium
for a play performed by a competing group to get over. </p>

<p> "How do I look?" asked Tara. </p>

<p>  "Good. You always look good" said Arjun. </p>

<p>  The students had constructed a high stage for her and had surrounded
  it with bright lights. </p>

<p> "When I am up there, I will wave to you. It is so high, I am scared if
  I fall I will die" said Tara. </p>

<p> Then it was time to be on stage. A group of people came to fetch Tara. </p>

<p> "I will wave to you from above. Do not move from this spot" said Tara
calling out to Arjun. </p>

<p> Her voice was drowning in the shouts of the directors of the show.
And soon she found herself on top of the stage looking down and a huge
crowd had gathered below. Her stunt was a huge success.  But where was
Arjun? He was nowhere to be seen. For a long time, Tara searched the
crowd for Arjun and she did not see him. Then she waited for the show
to end. She did not care anymore.  </p>

<p> As soon as the show was over, Tara went to Arjun's hostel. It was around
ten in the night but she did not care. She went and knocked at his door and
when Arjun opened the door she said  </p>

<p> "It was a hit. Why did you not wait for me? Did you see it was a hit?" </p>

<p> "Yes" said Arjun. "But when the crowd came to fetch you, I thought I
had lost you forever. I felt like you were gone forever."   </p>

<p> "I will never leave you, Arjun" said Tara giving him a hug.  </p>

<p> After sometime Tara said

"Gee, It is really late. I should not have come here, now. People will
gossip."  </p>

<p> "Wait for half an hour. This is the late canteen hour, the corridors will
be full of people. After that it should be safe to go" said Arjun.  </p>

<p> So after half hour, Arjun went and checked the corridors and then the
two of them slowly tiptoed out of the hostel. The watchman was fast
asleep at his chair.  </p>

<p> "Thank god for sleeping watchmen" said Tara laughing.  </p>

<p> A few days later the juniors were after Tara again.  </p>

<p> "Tara, will you be part of a crowd in our play today? We really
are short of people" said Monika.  </p>

<p> "No. No. I cannot. Arjun is really possessive about me. I cannot
take part in the play" said Tara.  </p>

<p> "Well, you just have to be part of a crowd. There is nothing to it.
It is a heaven scene and we need a crowd. Please, Tara. We really need
people" said Monika. </p>

<p> "Okay, let me ask Arjun" said Tara. </p>

<p> When Tara called up Arjun and asked him, he said that was fine. He said
he will come to see the play too. </p>

<p> So Tara dressed up as a goddess and she went along to be a part of the
crowd. Some people picked the girls from the hostel and Tara was one of
the last to reach backstage. </p>

<p> "Come, come. You are in the first scene. It is getting late" shouted
the director. When Tara entered the stage she was given the center
seat and she was surrounded by angels. No way was she part of a
crowd.  She could not tell whether she was a queen or a chief goddess
for she had no idea what the play was about. </p>

<p> She quite enjoyed the play when it started. It was about gods who were
having some dispute and it was funny. And when the scene ended a couple
of gods were punished to go to earth and Tara's role in the play was
over. She went down to search for Arjun.  </p>

<p> When she found Arjun, he did not look too happy.  </p>

<p> "That was not part of being a crowd. You were center stage" said Arjun.  </p>

<p> "I did not know that they were going to ask me to sit in the
center. Monika said I was going to be part of a crowd. Anyways,
someone had to sit in the center" said Tara and tickled Arjun till he
smiled.  </p>

<p> After sometime Tara said  </p>

<p> "Boy, it is tough to ride a mobike in a costume. You tend to feel you
will fall off."  </p>

<p> "What? You came here on someone's mobike?" asked Arjun really shocked.  </p>

<p> "Yes. I could not possibly walk on the street in a costume like this" said
Tara.  </p>

<p> That was it. Arjun was very angry.  </p>

<p> "All girls are like this. I want to have nothing to do with you" said
Arjun and he walked off in a huff.  </p>

<p> Tara did not know what to do. Then she saw the little tea shop where
students would gather to drink tea at all the odd hours of the day or
night.  The shop sold nothing but tea, a few biscuits, and
chocolates. She wanted to buy something for Arjun and she went and
bought all the chocolates in the jar in the shop for him.  </p>

<p> Arjun was quite happy with the gift and more than willing to forgive
and forget. He even shared some of the chocolates with his friends.  </p>

<p> "No girl has ever bought me chocolates before" said Arjun with a shy
smile.  </p>

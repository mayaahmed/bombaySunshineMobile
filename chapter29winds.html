<h3> Chapter 29  </h3>
<h2> Winds of change </h2>

<p> Many of Tara's friends were getting married and some were finding
exciting new career options. Every one did better than they expected.
It was challenging to get good breaks because competition was severe.
But life was good to Tara and her friends. </p>

<p> "I got admissions for masters in Bombay University'' said Rekha.
"The school starts in one week. Are you all ready to go and live in a
hostel?" </p>

<p> "Yes, I got my own room'' said Tara. "My school starts next week too.
It is a creme de la creme campus. Every student has their own
room. The administration treats the students very well. Nice change
from the clerks in our college." </p>

<p> "Our college clerks were terrible. We had to stand  in long lines for
everything. They would shut the windows at their convenience and
we had to go and stand in line again the next day. I wish someone
would tell them off. The clerks really don't care too much about
students." </p>

<p> "It is quite different in the Indian University. They are really very
good to students. The government treats this institute very well
too. No cutting of electricity or water. It is strange that no matter
where in the world you are some people get everything. It is like even
if there is a famine the rich always eat a full meal." </p>

<p> "I always wanted to live in a hostel."  </p>

<p> "Me too. And I will find out what it is like. I will arrange
the room to my taste and I will hang out with friends all the
time. I am sure it is going to be a breeze. Of course I wish
all of you were going with me too then it would be guaranteed
fun. Now I will have to make friends. I wonder what the
crowd is going to be like." </p>

<p> "Tara, you will easily make hundreds of friends like you
always do." </p>

<p> "Let us see. It is a beautiful campus lined with palm trees and
gul mohar trees. It is amazing that this suburb of Bombay
is so blessed in natural beauty. It has two great lakes
and the campus includes  parts of the lakes." </p>

<p> "I am sure you will spend a lot of time there."  </p>

<p> Kala's parents on the other hand were busy hunting a groom for Kala.
Kala brought forth a photograph of a young man and said "He is coming
to see me next week. Our horoscopes matched.  It is going to be
mostly alright since we already liked each other's pictures." </p>

<p> "He looks like a good chap. What is his name?" asked Tara.</p>

<p> "Ramesh. I got this picture here on the sly because I wanted to show
it to you all. I will replace it quietly." </p>

<p> "Hmmm. In front of your mother you will act as though you are not even
interested in looking at his picture'' said Rekha teasing. </p>

<p> "Not that I am that interested. I just wanted to show you people"
said Kala.</p>

<p> Tara said poetically </p>

<p> "Steady on proud heart, <br/>

lest love catches on, <br/>

and once the proud risen head, <br/>

bend in sweet shame." </p>


<p> Kala only blushed in reply.  </p>

<p> "It seems like a lot of our friends are getting married'' said Rekha.
 "A few of us are going on to study. I wonder where we will all be in
 ten years."  </p>

<p> "Here is where we are parting company and ways" said Tara. "Each of
 us to our destinations. It seems like life at different stages
 requires major changes and upheavals. I personally would like to hold
 on to this stage of my life a little longer." </p>

<p> "Why should you?" asked Rekha "You are going to have fun living in a
 hostel. And not to forget walking along lake sides.  Hey
 look at Kala. She is not listening to a word we are saying."</p>

<p> Sure enough Kala was looking at Ramesh's photograph and humming a
tune which Tara and Rekha recognized immediately and they sang </p>

<p> "Yeh aakh kaisi hai? Hai teer jaisi hai. Woh kaisa hoga jiski
tasveer aisi hai? ( These eyes are like arrows, what will he be like
whose photograph is like this?)" </p>

<p> Kala blushed again and ran away. </p>

<p> When Tara got home she saw her mother buy pots from the matkawali
(woman Pot seller). The matkawali was a very old woman. She sat
on the floor of the common veranda with her wares all over
the place. </p>

<p> Tara's mother was buying pots for plants. Tara became a little
nostalgic about matkas (pots that held drinking water) in recent past.
The old lady's basket had matkas of different shapes and sizes and of
two colors, brick red and black.  The matkas had  taps and lids.  </p>

<p> Tara picked up a few matkas and admired them.  </p>

<p> "It is too bad that fridges have replaced matkas" said Tara. "I
guess now if we  buy matkas it would be only for decor."   </p>

<p> "Yes, beti" said the seller. "The matka selling is not doing very
well. But poor people still buy matkas. Now the market is more for
kundis(flower pots). Poor people like us have to get by one way or the
other."  </p>

<p> "Maji, you must continue making matkas" said Tara. "I hope matkas
never go out of market. They are so pretty."  </p>

<p> Tara turned to her mother and asked  </p>

<p> "Ma, can we buy a matka? I will drink water out of it."  </p>

<p> "There is no place in the house Tara"  said Tara's mother.  </p>
 
<p> Tara's mother only bought a few flower pots.  </p>

<p> "No market for matkas anymore except among the poor" the old lady
repeated. She put her money carefully in a little cloth pouch.  She
then took out a beedi and smoked it.  Tara was really surprised and
she asked  </p>

<p> "Maji you smoke?"  </p>

<p> "Yes, it is only a beedi not a cigarette"  said the old lady  justifying
her action.  </p>

<p> Tara watched the old woman smoke in wonder for she had never seen
any woman smoke before.  </p>

<p> "Only in Hollywood movies have I seen women smoke" said Tara. "This
comes as a surprise to me. I never thought that such an old woman
would smoke."  </p>

<p> After the old lady finished her beedi, she made a little turban of
a piece of cloth and placed it on her head. Then she said  </p>

<p> "Give me a hand beti."   </p>

<p> Tara helped lift the basket of pots and placed it on the old woman's
head. The old lady descended the stairs slowly and once out in the
street shouted "Kundi le lo, Matka le lo (Buy a flower pot, buy a
water pot)" and went her way.  </p>

<p> "I never saw a woman smoke before" said an amazed Tara. </p>

<p> "Women from that class are allowed to smoke" said Tara's mother. </p>

<p> "What is allowed in one class is scandalous in another" said
Tara. "Indian society is funny. Some women are allowed to smoke just
because they belong to a class." </p>

<p> "Middle class society is the class where a lot of things are not
allowed" said Tara's mother. "The rich and the poor have few rules." </p>

<p> "Yes, all their dos and donts connect to money matters" said
Tara. "Their concerns are mostly materialistic. The middle class is
the moralistic lot. What would you say if I smoked a cigarette?" </p>


<p> "Don't even think of such things" said Tara's mother. "It will mess
up your health.  I don't understand why you even have such a thought. I
am worried about you." </p>

<p> "I was only kidding" said Tara really surprised at her
mother's reaction. "I will go get some mud for the pots." </p>

<p> Tara's mother gave her a few blue and pink plastic bags to bring mud
in.  Tara picked up an old knife which had no handles to dig
mud. Seeta turned up and wanted to go along too. So Tara searched the
tool box and found another knife without a handle for Seeta. Knives
used for digging could not be used in the kitchen. So they had to find
knives that were beyond repair. Tara and Seeta went to the maidan
and slowly dug the ground and gathered mud into the plastic bags. </p>

<p> "I think I am falling in love" said Seeta. </p>

<p> "What? You too?" asked Tara a little disappointed. "So soon you will
be married too. I thought you were enrolled in a Masters program at
Bombay university." </p>

<p> "I am not marrying yet. I am not sure that I am in love" said Seeta.  </p>

<p>  "Can this be love? <br/>

I smile when he comes, <br/>

and cry when he leaves, <br/>

I always feel his presence, <br/>

whether far or near, <br/>

and he never leaves my thoughts, <br/>

Now can this be love?" </p>   


<p> "Who is it?" asked Tara. </p>  

<p>"I will tell you when I am sure" said Seeta. </p>  

<p> Just then there was a lot of noise and Tara and Seeta got
up to see whats going on. </p>   
 

<p> "You cannot take mud from here. This mud belongs to Singh"
a woman was shouting at Seema Akka. </p> 

<p> Seema Akka was collecting mud for her pots from a ground near Singh's
garden. Singh had a flat on the ground floor and hence had a garden he
was extremely proud of. He bought special mud for his garden and took
extreme care of his garden. Seema Akka was not taking mud from his
garden but the woman misunderstood and she was kicking up a fuss for no
reason. </p> 

<p>  This made Seema Akka very angry. Seema Akka did not know much Hindi
for she was from a little village from the south of India.  She had
spend a lot of years in Bombay after her marriage but she had never
bothered to learn Hindi well. Now she wanted to say that this was not
your mud or my mud or Singh's mud but it was common mud and belonged
to everyone but what she said instead in her anger was  </p> 

<p>  "Tum matti, hum matti, Singh mutti, sab mutti (which meant you are
mud, I am mud, Singh is mud, all are mud)."  </p> 

<p>  Tara and Seeta laughed when they heard this and Seeta said  </p> 

<p> "Seema Akka we never knew you were a philosopher."  </p> 

<p>  The two girls spend some time repeating Seema Akka's tum matti hum
matti line and laughing about it before they got back home. </p> 

<p> "Tum matti, hum matti, Singh mutti, sab mutti" said Tara when she met
her mother.  </p> 

<p> "I don't know what you are talking about" said Tara's mother puzzled and
this made the two girls laugh.  </p> 

<p>  "Now your mother will think you are smoking something" said Seeta laughing.  </p> 

<p> "Do not talk like that" warned Tara's mother.  </p> 


<p> Tara's mother filled her pots with the mud and planted cuttings of
rose plants in them. She put some dried cow dung as manure, watered
the plants, and placed then in the little balcony. </p> 

<p> "You have something to tell me?" asked Tara as Seeta was leaving. </p> 

<p> "Yes, I will tell you as soon as I know" said Seeta. </p> 

<p> "And how will you know?" asked Tara </p> 

<p> "Time will tell" said Seeta leaving without telling another word. </p> 

<p> "Whatever" said Tara with a shrug. </p>

<h3> Chapter 28  </h3>
<h2>Raji gets married  </h2>


<p> When Tara saw Raji's wedding card she asked her mother "How come I
know nothing about it?" </p>

<p> "It was arranged quickly" said Tara's mother.  </p>

<p> "I must go see her now" said Tara running out of the house. </p>

<p> When Tara reached Raji's house, she could see the door of Raji's house
decorated with garlands of mango leaves and marigold flowers. There
was a Rangoli drawn at the doorsteps and there was a festive
environment in the house. </p>

<p> When  Raji's mother saw Tara she said </p>

<p> "Raji is sitting and listening to the saddest songs on the tape
recorder in her room. You know how it is for girls. They hate
to leave their father's home." </p>

<p> "I understand" said Tara. </p>

<p> Tara  heard the song floating from Raji's room:  </p>

<p> "Teri duniya se door, <br/>

chale hoke majboor, <br/>

hume yaad rakhna..... <br/>

(Which meant I am leaving your world under duress,
remember me)." </p>


<p> "I am sad" said Raji when she saw Tara.   </p>

<p> Raji was relieved to find someone who she could confide in.  </p>

<p> "You are getting married?" asked Tara.  </p>

<p> "Yes. It all got arranged quickly. My younger sister's marriage is on
the same day. My parents are very happy that we both will get such
good husbands. This will also save a lot of money for my parents."  </p>

<p> "But you cannot..." Tara began to say.  </p>

<p> Tara saw Raji's mother come in just then and so she hushed up.  </p>

<p> "Have some sweets" said Raji's mother. "This is a wedding house. You
cannot leave without eating some sweets."   </p>

<p> "Thank you" said Tara.  </p>

<p> "I want to go with Tara for a walk" said Raji.  </p>

<p> "Do not go too far. You are a bride to be and you might catch the
evil eye. Come back soon."   </p>

<p> "Yes mother" said Raji. </p>

<p> As Tara and Raji left the room the song continued </p>

<p> "Ayengi bahare, teri hi fasane sunayegi hume...(When the springs come
it will tell only your stories)." </p>

<p> "Tara, they say it is better to love and lose" said Raji. "I do not
see that. I am miserable. It would have been better if I never
had met Mandar." </p>

<p> "Don't you have any other alternative?" asked Tara. </p>

<p> "No. Mandar has no job. He is too young. My younger sister cannot get
married till I am married. I have no choice."  </p>

<p> "How is Mandar taking this news?" asked Tara. </p>

 <p> "He is being brave. He knows there is no choice either." </p>

<p> "In two days you will be married to an unknown man." </p>

<p> "Yes, Tara. I heard you are going to Indian University for studies.
Congratulations. Our paths will be so different now. You will study
and become something and I will be married and will be taking care of
a huge household. I wish I could study too." </p>

<p> "Can't you study?" asked Tara. </p>

<p> "It seems my husband is a very open minded person and he might let me
study. Let us see." </p>

<p> "Don't you think that you should at least try to do something about this
situation?" asked Tara.</p>

<p> "I do not have guts Tara. I am not that brave to take on the entire
system of parents, relatives, and society. Also there is no hope.
Mandar is too young for marriage. You know how it is in society,
a man cannot marry till he has a good career and a girl has to get
married just as soon as she is eighteen." </p>

<p> They met  Sarita on the road. Tara was happy to see Sarita. </p>

<p> "Let us talk to Sarita" said Tara. "She is more mature and she will
understand this situation better." </p>

<p> "Well, nothing matters" said Sarita. "Whoever Raji marries it is the
same set of compromises she has to make. Married life with Mandar may
be tougher since he still has to get a handle on his life whereas this
man is all settled and looks reasonable. Plus you will have the entire
system geared up to support you." </p>

<p> "Cold logic wins over the voices of the heart then" said Tara. </p>

<p> "Depends on her. Whatever you choose life will have its ups and downs"
said Sarita. </p>

<p> "You two must come to my wedding" said Raji. </p>

<p> "Of course, Raji. Will Mandar be coming for your wedding too?" asked
Tara. </p>

<p> "No. He has gone to Poona" said Raji. "He will be there the whole of
this month.  I already bid him goodbye yesterday. It is best this
way." </p>

<p> Raji's mother soon came looking for Raji. Brides to be were to stay home
otherwise the evil eye would make them sick. </p>

<p> "I have to go Tara" said Raji. "I will try and do my duty and be a
good wife." </p>

<p> Raji then went home.</p>

<p> "Tough" said Tara.</p>

<p> "Life is tough for some people" said Sarita. "But looks like you
will be able to do exactly what you want. I heard you are going to the
Indian university. Now you are among the elite and none of the rules
touch you any longer.  You are above rules when you are an elite."</p>

<p> "I was always above rules" said Tara. "Rules are for the proles.
You are a prole only if you believe you are one. I am no prole." </p>

<p> "Do you think Raji is a prole?" asked Sarita.</p>

<p> "No" said Tara biting her tongue. "Raji is not a prole but you
know what I mean anyways."</p>

<p> "Yes. I think I understand a little" said Sarita laughing. </p> 


<p> Soon it was time to attend Raji's wedding. Tara looked through her
mother's many silk saris trying to decide what to wear for Raji's
wedding. She finally chose a rust red sari with a black and white
border. Her mother brought out some jewelry that went well with the
Sari. Tara's mother was very happy whenever Tara wore saris.  Sari
wearing was a skill that Tara did not know yet so her mother had to
help her. When Tara was all dressed up her mother exclaimed </p>

<p> "You look so nice. Indian women look best in saris. Now wear
a black beauty spot on your chin else you will catch the evil
eye." </p>

<p> "Black beauty spots on chins are silly. I will wear this tiny black
bindi on my forehead to keep you happy." </p>

<p> Tara's friends were already waiting for her outside. They all wore
pretty silk saris and lots of jewelry . They took cabs to the wedding
hall. The hall was decorated with lots of lights and flowers. When the
girls reached the wedding hall Raji was already sitting with her soon
to be husband in front of a fire and the marriage rites were going on.
There were drummers playing the drum all the time. Raji's mother
greeted them at the door. She was very happy that both her daughters
were getting married the same day. Accompanied by very loud music on
the drums the groom tied the thali (gold locket) around the bride's
neck.  </p>

<p> Raji was dressed in a red silk sari and she looked very beautiful. She
looked distant and Tara somehow felt that now nothing
mattered. Everyone including Tara or Mandar were images of the
past. Raji was going in to a completely new world and she looked a
little dazed. It appeared that the elaborate ceremony flushed out all
memories of the past from Raji.</p>

<p> After the ceremony lunch was served. The bride and the groom sat to
eat and everything they did was video taped or photographed.</p>

<p> "You are eating alone? Give bhabi (sister in law) some sweets" said one guy.</p>

<p> So the groom took a Gulab jamun and offered it to Raji.</p>

<p> "Too sweet. I do not want it" said Raji softly. </p>

<p> The rituals of the wedding which lasted now for two whole days were
tiring and she was very mellow.</p>

<p> "Okay. I will drain the sugar syrup out" said the groom and he offered
it again to Raji. Raji let the gulab jamun linger on her painted lips
for a while before biting it and then she smiled.</p>

<p>  Tara watched Raji for sometime and told Sarita </p>

<p>  "I think Raji will forget Mandar." </p>

<p>  "Tara, you are very young" said Sarita. "But let me tell you the
psyche of Indian women. As soon as the thali is tied on a woman's neck
she will play the role of Savitri who went after lord Yama to save her
husband's life. We are conditioned that way since childhood and even
thinking about Mandar will be a crime to her.  In one year's time if
you meet her she will not want to hear the name of Mandar and he will
be something she would like to forget from the past. Forget Raji, look
at the women who married men they loved. They want people to
completely forget that they ever were in love. Love they think is a
mistake of youth and treated as such. I will show you an example." </p>

<p>  Sarita  then pointed  to Yamuna and said </p>

<p> "We all know that Yamuna married her neighbor and she was in
love with him. Now watch the fun." </p>

<p> She went over to Yamuna and asked </p>

<p> "Hi Yamuna. Nice wedding, isn't it? Does it remind you of yours?" </p>

<p> "In a way" said Yamuna. </p>

<p> "Of course, yours was a little different. It was a love marriage." </p>


<p> "Of course not. Bachon ke samne (in front of kids)" said an angry
Yamuna pointing with her eyes to the little daughter who was
listening. </p>

<p> Now Sarita was in a naughty mood so she persisted </p>

<p> "But I thought that you had a love marriage." </p>

<p> "Those are rumors. I had a proper marriage and my father chose
the guy. These rumors exist mainly because he was my neighbor." </p>

<p> "Well I heard..." said Sarita. </p>

<p> "No no, nothing of that sort." </p>

<p> Yamuna then walked away and sat in the opposite end of the hall, as
far as she could from Sarita. She was very angry to be reminded of her
love life. </p>

<p>Tara found the whole thing funny and she sat down and laughed her head off. </p>

<p> "You want me to trouble Yamuna more?" asked Sarita. </p>

<p> "No. It will not be necessary" said Tara. "I see the point clearly."  </p>

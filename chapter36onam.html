<h3> Chapter 36  </h3>
<h2>Visiting an orphanage</h2>

<p> It was the Onam  week. The hostel was organizing a grand
lunch  for Onam. The  Malayali girls  were planning  to make
rangoli with flowers  and perform Kaikottikali. Kaikottikali
was  a dance where  people went  around in  circles clapping
their  hands   and  wearing  a  mundu  set   which  was  the
traditional dress  of Kerala. But  Tara went home  for Onam.
She helped  her mother prepare  the grand Onam  meal. Tara's
friends  Seeta, Sarita,  and Seema  came over  for  the Onam
lunch. </p>

<p> "We are going to eat anj curry, inj narangya" said Tara.  </p>

<p> "What is that?" asked Seema.  </p>

<p> "Anj curry means five curries, inj means ginger, and narangya means
lemon" said Tara. "This is the minimum requirements for a Onam
meal. It has to be all vegetarian."  </p>

<p> "I like Onam" said Sarita. "The fact that all Malayalees celebrate
Onam irrespective of religion is an example for the rest of the
country. Keralites are very secular that way."  </p>


<p> "The story goes that a king visits every year and he would be sad if
he saw the people of Kerala not happy" said Seeta. "So during Onam
even the poor eat well. The rich make sure they do."   </p>

<p> "It is basically a harvest festival" said Seema.  </p>

<p> "That is right" said Sarita. "It is a harvest festival. People
all over the world have harvest festivals. Harvests are time to celebrate."  </p>

<p> "It does not make sense to us. We know nothing about harvests" said Seema.  </p>

<p> "But we know how to celebrate what we know nothing of" said Tara laughing.  </p>

<p> Tara's mother placed mats on the floor and served lunch on banana leaves.  </p>

<p> "No dining tables today. Must sit on the floor with legs folded" said Tara.  </p>

<p> "I love eating out of banana leaves" said Sarita.  </p>

<p> "When you are done you fold your leaf so that they wont serve you
further" said Sarita. </p>

<p> When Tara saw all the food served on her leaf, she told her mother </p>

<p> "This is way beyond anj curry inj narangya. You cooked ten curries
at least."  </p>


<p> "Onam only comes once a year" Tara's mother said smiling. </p>

<p> After Lunch Sarita was planning to visit an orphanage. Time and again Tara
had helped Sarita with flood reliefs or collecting money for charity.
But Tara had never been to an orphanage before. </p>

<p> "Can we come along?" asked Tara. </p>

<p> "If you want to" said Sarita. </p>

<p> Tara, Seeta, and Seema decided to follow Sarita to the orphanage that
day. The orphanage was a tiny apartment with only a couple of rooms.
Most children were sleeping in cradles and a few children were on the
floor. Tara noticed that a child was crying out loud. When Tara asked
why the child was crying  a  maid said that the child was hungry. The maid
said that she was warming milk to give it to the child. </p>

<p> Tara went  near the cradle and peeped  at the child. The
child was a beautiful girl with really long lashes. Seeing a
human face  the child smiled.  Tara lifted the child  up and
the  child continued  to  smile. The  child's smile  somehow
pained  Tara.  It  was  a  smile  of  utter  loneliness  and
abandonment.  It was a  smile which  said I  do not  want to
bother  you  the  least,  please  like me.  It  was  somehow
misplaced in a little infant. Tara played with the child for
sometime and Tara  did not feel like keeping  the child down
all  through  her  visit.  Tara  looked  around  the  little
orphanage  and   in  one  room   she  saw  some   women  and
children. </p>

<p>  "These mothers are here only for a month" explained Sarita. "They
 will give up their children to the orphanage soon. We let them stay
 here for sometime since it is good for children to be with their
 birth mothers as long as possible." </p>


<p> "I wonder why they are giving up their children" said Tara. </p>

 <p> "Girl child. If you notice the majority of the children here are
 girls. Unwed mothers are another reason" explained Sarita. </p>
 

<p>  Tara watched the women who were giving up their children. She could
 not tell that they had any compulsions or sorrows. Most women tried
 to make themselves useful as much as possible. They helped with the
 tailoring and taking care of other children. They laughed at jokes
 but they would never mention why they were giving up a child. </p>

<p>  It was time for Tara to go back and the little child that Tara was
 carrying around had in that short time formed a strong bond with
 Tara. Tara put the child back in the cradle with great difficulty.
 When Tara got out of the orphanage she sat down on a bench a little
 overwhelmed. </p>


 <p> "Depressing" said Tara. "This visit is really depressing. I feel
 like I just left a room filled with an atmosphere of choking misery." </p>

<p>  "It is tough on people. Orphanages are not picnic spots" said Sarita
 calmly. </p>

 <p> "I am sorry Sarita" said Tara. "I think I am kind but I am not
 strong. My kindness is of no purpose. But if you are strong and not
 kind you might be of greater value to society than being a barrel
 full of emotions like me. If you are kind and strong then it is the
 best way to be. I fail in emotional strength and I feel like a wimp." </p> 


<p>  "Each person is made for a different purpose" said Sarita. "This is
 one of the good orphanages where the children are treated
 well. Believe me it can get worse than this." </p>


<p> "Do you get depressed?" asked Tara. </p>

<p>  "Sometimes I do. But some of us have to be strong. Don't we?" asked
 Sarita smiling. </p>

<p>  "Yes" said Tara quietly. </p>

<p>   "Now I have to go. I have to go to a meeting" said Sarita. </p>

 <p>  Tara and her friends walked back home each of them lost in their own
 thoughts talking very little to each other. The visit to the
 orphanage had affected them in a way more than they ever thought it
 would. </p>

 <p>  When Tara reached home she gave her  mother a hug and said </p>

 <p>  "Thank you, ma." </p>

 <p>  Her mother was a little surprised for she had no idea that Tara had
 visited an orphanage.  </p>

<p>  "Oh, did you really like  the Onam lunch then?" asked Tara's mother. </p>

 <p>  "Yes, after the hostel food this is manna from heaven" said Tara laughing.</p>

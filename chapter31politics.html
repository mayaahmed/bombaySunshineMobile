<h3> Chapter 31  </h3>
<h2>Keep away from politics</h2>

<p> Attending the Indian university was not only about academics. This
institute was a stepping stone for all kinds of careers even politics.
Tara met many students who were already members of political
parties. Tara got invitations to many student political meetings.
Tara's hostel mate Rajini was a member of the communist party. </p>

<p> "There is a meeting in the main building you might like to attend"
said Rajini.  "We will be talking about the reasons for the economical
problems in our country." </p>

<p> "That sounds interesting" said Tara. </p>

<p> "See you in MB 101 at six in the evening." said Rajini. </p>

<p> Rajini was quite happy to recruit Tara for her group. </p>

<p> Now Jyoti belonged to the Group for Indian development and she wanted
Tara to join her group. </p>

<p> "Our meeting of the Group for Indian development is also in MB 101" said
Jyoti. "It is at eight in the night immediately after the communists
meeting. Will you come for it?" </p>

<p> "I will surely like to hear about developing India" said Tara. "I
will be there." </p>

<p> Jyoti went away happily. Tara realized it was an important task to
recruit new cadets for a group.  </p>

<p> "Group for Indian development? What is that?" asked Mala.  </p>

<p> "This group I believe is associated to a fundamentalist political
party" said Tara. "But they do not want to be obviously political
and so they have this high sounding name. All that altruism is a cover
for a covet political agenda."  </p>

<p> "For some reason these politicians get interested in you."  </p>

<p> "I think they are looking for morons and I probably look like one."  </p> 

<p> "Why are you going for these meetings then?"  </p>

<p> "I now know a lot of people from these groups. I do not agree to all
that they say but I like the fact that they have interesting
opinions. At political meetings and rallies you see comedy at its
best. And I could use some laughs right now. My grades are not that
great in last week's exams."  </p>

<p> "You should study harder."  </p>

<p> "Facing an exam almost everyday has taken away my fear of exams.
My fear of doing badly was what made me study before. Now I am
getting used to it."  </p>


<p> "Frequent exams are a bother."  </p>


<p> "Yes. I am used to my undergraduate study system where there is only
one finals every year.  I only had to study hard for one month to make
sure I get good grades. Now I have to study every day to do well. Also
I am a little demotivated and I might change careers."  </p>

<p> "Maybe you can become a politician" said Mala laughing.  </p>

<p> "I would rather observe the politicians than become one. They provide
great mirth and I am going to have ring side seats today."   </p>


<p> When Tara went to MB 101 that evening, she saw a little crowd had
gathered there already.  Rajini was happy to see her and she gave a
little wave to Tara even though she was seated at a table on the
stage.  </p>

<p> "It is my great pleasure to introduce my dear comrade, Abhay Mittal"
said Rajini. "He is a historian and has a PhD in history. He is also
a journalist and a professor. Abhay Mittal, the floor is all yours."  </p>

<p> Abhay Mittal's talk went well since he talked mainly about history and
so did a couple of other talks. But when Sanjay Ghose started to talk
about why India was having financial problems because of a certain
fundamentalist party the crowd in the room started getting restless.  </p>

<p> "Arm chaired communists" one boy shouted.  </p>

<p> "We will not be daunted by allegations" said Sanjay Ghose. "Calling
insulting names are not going to stop us from telling the truth. The
truth will be told even if there is bloodshed."  </p>

<p>  Tara found that statement funny so did a lot of others and the
crowd laughed.  </p>

<p> "Coward. You will cry if you chip a nail" another boy shouted.  </p>

<p> "Who dares call me a coward?" asked Sanjay Ghose. "I am a fearless
teller of the truth."  </p>


<p> "Let us not get personal" said Abhay Mittal standing up. "We are here
for achieving higher goals.  We are here to solve the problems facing
our country. We have major problems. We must sit and think and solve
them."  </p>

<p> The meeting continued with these kinds of interruptions.  When the
shouting and insults got really bad Abhay Mittal would stand up and
say  </p>

<p> "I will have to ask people who are not interested in the serious
proceedings that is going on here to leave." </p>

<p> After two hours it was time for the Group for Indian development
to take over the room and they did. </p>

<p> Rajini walked up to Tara and said "Those people who were making
all that noise belonged to the fundamentalist party. They will
not let people hear the truth." </p>

<p> "Yes. They were behaving badly. I noticed" said Tara. </p>

<p> There was very little talk about economics at the meeting of the Group
for Indian development. It was mostly about Gurk culture. No one
bothered to connect this culture to Indian development either. </p>

<p> "Everyone must say that we are Gurks, or they do not have a right
to live in this country" said the speaker. </p>

<p> "Why do you say that?" came a question from the audience. </p>

<p> "Being a Gurk is not about religion" said the speaker.  "The
definition about being a Gurk is the one who lives near Himalayas. All
Indians live near Himalayas and we should be proud of being called a
Gurk." </p>

<p> "I do not feel particularly proud being called a Gurk" said another
voice from the audience. "If you call me a Gurk I might get rather
annoyed." </p>

<p> "Then you have no right to live in this country" said the
speaker. "This country belongs to the Gurks. We express our
patriotism and solidarity by being proud of being a Gurk. Anyone who
resents being a Gurk is a trouble maker and is not patriotic. They are
not part of the Indian culture. Indian culture is Gurk culture."  </p>

<p> This brought forth aggressive cheering from the supporters in the
audience and one man got up and shouted </p>

<p> "Say proudly we are Gurks." </p>

<p> The crowd shouted "We are Gurks. We are proud to be Gurks." </p>

<p> The next speaker defined what Gurk culture was all about and why
it was the oldest culture and the best culture for all Indians. </p>

<p> "We need a common culture. We have a common culture, the Gurk
culture" said the speaker. </p>

<p> "Hear, hear. Gurk culture zindabad" came shouts from the audience. </p>

<p> The enthusiasm of the crowd greatly affected the speakers and they got
bolder and the successive speakers now no longer restricted their
speech to saying how great Gurk culture was. They started insulting
other cultures that were not Gurk culture and at that point Tara
decided to leave the meeting. </p>

<p> Tara got back to her hostel room and found her friend Meena studying.
Meena did not for some reason like her own room and she hardly spend
any time there. She felt more comfortable in Tara's room even when
Tara was not there. Tara never locked her room for there were no
robberies in the campus. </p>

<p> "How was the meeting?" asked Meena. </p>

<p> "Disturbing" said Tara. "Somehow politicians stink of irreparable
mischief to me.  The opinions they hold and profess destroy social
fabric. They do not give a damn. All they care is holding the reins of
power." </p>


<p> Tara later wrote down in her diary: </p>

<p> "This is no game they are playing. These meetings are held in campus
with serious purpose. This is where the ideas are transferred slowly
but surely into unsuspecting young minds. Even if they do not
become politicians the students as grown ups will live with these ideas.
This is one way of bringing about social change whether good or bad.
I go there for a laugh but soon the laugh may be on me. So I swear that
I will keep away from politics." </p>

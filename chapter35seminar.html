<h3> Chapter 35  </h3>
<h2> Of seminars and presentations </h2>

<p> Tara was sitting at the mess table slowly sipping her morning tea. </p>

<p> "Today I have to give a presentation. I have to give my talk on
shock waves" said Tara.  </p>

<p> "Are you all prepared?" asked Mala.  </p>

<p> "My slides are ready. Let us see how it goes. I have never given a seminar
talk before" said Tara.  </p>

<p> "It should be a breeze. I had to give my talk yesterday.  No sweat at
all" said Mala.  </p>

<p> Tara went to the department a little early. Her classmate Jagdish was
giving a talk on the same topic of shock waves.  Tara and Jagdish
had the same adviser so she wanted to see what was going on. She was
just in time to see Jagdish begin his talk.  </p>

<p> To Tara's surprise she saw that Jagdish's audience consisted only of
three intimidating professors. Jagdish was all dressed in formal
attire with a tie and polished boots. Tara felt a slight remorse at
her own attire which was a very informal jeans and shirt and to top
that she wore bathroom slippers. Wearing bathroom slippers was
considered very "in" in the campus but it now felt like the wrong
choice.  </p>

<p> "Minus ten points for my attire" said Tara to herself. She waited
a little to see how Jagdish was going to start his talk and soon he said  </p>

<p> "Whenever a body moves faster than sound we have shock waves......."  </p>

<p> Tara did not wait to listen any further. That was exactly how her slides
began. There was no time to make new slides. Tara saw Meena turn up at the
stairs just then and Meena looked really tense.  </p>

<p> "I am not myself today" said Meena. "I stayed awake all night
preparing for my talk. Now I am scared stiff. I do not know how I will
give my talk."  </p>

<p> "When is your talk?"  </p>

<p> "In an hour."  </p> 

<p> "Then it is after my talk. I will have to talk in another twenty minutes.
I am not looking forward to it. I just found out that Jagdish started his
talk with the very lines I am going to use."   </p>

<p> "Don't tell me! I am going to the Library till the time comes" said Meena
sounding as though she was going to be executed.  </p>

<p> "Good luck Meena" said Tara.  </p>

<p>  "Same to you" said Meena disappearing into the little library.  </p>

<p>  When Tara went back to the room where she was to give a talk in, she
saw a triumphant Jagdish stepping out of the stage. She could sense a
little bow he gave regally to the adoring audience of professors.  </p>

<p> There was nothing to do but face the music said Tara to herself. Soon
Tara put up her slide and went "Whenever a body moves faster than
sound we have shock waves ..." </p>

<p> She felt absurd talking to the Professors who were experts in shock
waves but they put on an act as though they were hearing about
shock waves for the first time. She could see one professor nodding
with great interest, another with an expression of intense curiosity,
and the third professor who was not such an actor yawning a couple of
times. In the middle of her talk she looked at the nodding professor
who nodded more under her scrutiny and she found it a little funny and
she laughed. The crowd of three laughed too thinking that there was a
joke somewhere and they were after all good sports. </p>

<p> Tara was happy when she was done talking her bit about shock waves and
she decided to sit in for Meena's talk.  Meena began her talk about
Fluid flow in a cylindrical tube and she wrote down a couple of flow
equations on the board. </p>

<p> "Now what would these equations be for a fluid flow in a twisted tube?"
asked one Professor. </p>

<p> "Aaaah, hmmm ..." started Meena. </p>

<p> When another Professor asked "What do you mean by twisted tube?" </p>

<p> "I will show you with a picture" said the first professor and he went
to the board and drew a  twisted tube for everyone to see. </p>
 
<p> "I think the first equation will probably hold but I am not sure
about the third" said the second professor. </p>

<p> "Aaah hmmm..." began poor Meena again but it was no use. The three
professors had started arguing about boundary conditions and the
boards were full of pictures of all sorts of twisted tubes and they
were writing down next to the pictures that equations 1,2,3 hold for
this tube and equations 2 and 3 hold for the other and so on and so
forth. </p>

<p> "Aah hmm ..." tried Meena again after sometime only to find that the
three professors were in a heated argument about some twisted tube so
she pulled a chair and sat down. She had worked very hard preparing
for this talk and soon she drowsed off. After a good five minutes she
woke up with a start and asked </p>

<p> "Tara, I slept. That was foolish of me. Did they find out I slept?" </p>

<p> "No. They were busy arguing about the same twisted tube" said Tara. </p>

<p> "I know nothing about twisted tubes. I was going to talk about
plain old cylindrical tubes" said Meena. </p>

<p> The whisperings of the two girls brought the professors back to
reality and one professor said </p>

<p> "Continue with your talk. Most illuminating talk. Very interesting.
You must continue." </p>

<p> But just then the next speaker turned up at the door and so it was time
to end.  Meena said with a very wide grin </p>

<p> "I would have gladly talked more but time constraints force me to end
this talk." </p>

<p> "Very interesting talk. The best so far" said one professor. </p>

<p> Tara and  Meena laughed all the way back to the hostel. </p>

<h3> Chapter 22  </h3>
<h2> Tara's student</h2>

<p> Bhandiwallas were people who would exchange steel vessels for old
clothes. Tara's mother had summoned a bhandiwalla to get rid of all
the unused and discarded clothes in the house. </p>

<p> "Give me that big pot" said Tara's mother to the bhandiwalla. </p>

<p> "These old clothes are not enough for that pot" said the
bhandiwalla. "Do you have any more old saris?" </p>

<p> "I do not have any more saris to give away.  But I have a few old
aluminum vessels if you like." </p>

<p> "Show me the vessels."  </p>

<p> Tara's mother brought out some old broken aluminum pots. The
Bhandiwalla agreed to give Tara's mother the steel pot she wanted in
exchange of the clothes and aluminum pots.  Tara's mother held the
pot in her hand and she looked happy with it. </p>

<p> "Mother, I do not understand why you like vessels and pots so much"
said Tara. </p>

<p> "When you get married I have to give you pots and pans" said Tara's
mother. "I am collecting for it."  </p>

<p> "Why do you always think of my marriage? Why are you in such a hurry
to get rid of me?" </p>

<p> "That is a mother's job. To worry about her daughter's marriage." </p>

<p> "Do I get this pot as dowry?" asked Tara with a grin. </p>

<p> "You can have it if you want."  </p>

<p> "In general I am against dowry. But I think I might accept this pot. Let me consider it."  </p>

<p> Tara then walked around with the pot in her hand saying </p>

<p> "My dowry. My dowry. My dowry." </p>

<p> "Stop it Tara" said her mother laughing. </p>

<p> Just then  Seema Akka  came to the door with another lady and said </p>

<p> "This lady wants someone to teach her daughter math and science. Do
you think Tara can teach?" </p>

<p> "Ask Tara" said Tara's mother. "There she is playing with a pot." </p>

<p> "Seema Akka. Look at my dowry" said Tara showing her the pot. </p>

<p> "Chee! How can you talk about your dowry so openly? You should be more
shy about such things. When someone mentions marriage a girl should
bend down her head and say issh. The girls these days are just too
much" said Seema Akka scandalized. </p>

<p> "Okay. Issh if you like. But look at my dowry pot."  </p>

<p> Tara laughed and handed the pot to Seema Akka to take a closer look. </p>

<p> "You want me to teach math and science to your daughter?" Tara asked
the lady who came with Seema Akka. "I have never taught before. It
might be fun. Is your daughter good at studies?" </p>

<p> "She is very hard working but she is weak in math. How much fees will
you take?" </p>

<p> Tara thought for a minute but she had no idea what to expect and so
she asked </p>

<p> "What are you paying right now?" </p>

<p> "Two hundred and fifty rupees. But I will pay you three hundred since
you have no other student. Is that fine?" </p>

<p> "Sounds fine" said Tara. </p>

<p> "Okay. So she will come for lessons from tomorrow. Thank you." </p>

<p> When the lady left Tara said </p>

<p> "I will make three hundred rupees per month from now on. I am going to
be rich. Meet rich Tara from now on."  </p>


<p> "I would have thought that lady would refuse to trust you with her
daughter's education after seeing you walk around with a pot" said
Tara's mother laughing. </p>

<p> "This is serious responsibility" said Tara worried. "I hope I can
teach well. I am scared." </p>

<p> Tara's mother looked at Tara and realized this was time for motherly
encouragement and said </p>

<p> "Tara, dear child. you will do just fine." </p>

<p> So the next day Tara's student turned up at five in the evening. When
Tara went to the living room to meet her student she saw this little
girl sitting on the chair with her arms folded. Her books were on the
table. The books were all covered neatly with brown paper and had
pretty labels on them. </p>

<p> "What is your name?" asked Tara. </p>

<p> "Smita" said the little girl. </p>

<p> Tara wondered about whether she should be friendly or act strict and
grim.  Tara was at a loss on how to behave. The little girl clearly
was in awe of her. Tara decided to stick to math. </p>

<p> "So what did your teacher do in class today?" Tara asked. </p>

<p> Smita showed her a chapter from her textbook. Tara assigned some
problems and asked her to do it and Smita did all of them correctly. </p>

<p> "You know how to do all these problems" said Tara. "I do not know
what to teach you. How come they say you are weak in math? Let us do
this. You try out the problems in the book and if you are stuck ask
me." </p>

<p> Smita could do almost all the problems herself and the few questions
she had were really easy to answer. Tara once in a while asked
questions from Smita's science notebook and Smita knew all
answers. Within a few weeks Smita started doing very well in school to
Tara's pleasant surprise because as far as Tara could tell Smita did
everything on her own.  Tara hardly ever taught her anything. One day
Tara asked her </p>

<p> "Smita. Tell me. You are a good student. How come you did not do this
well before? You took tuition from someone else and how did that
person teach you?" </p>

<p> "That lady would give me ten problems to do ten times each and turn in
every week and if I did not do it she would hit me" said Smita. </p>

<p> "She would hit you? That is wrong.  Also it is silly to do the same
problem ten times." </p>

<p> "Yes" said Smita. </p>

<p> "Did it hurt?" asked Tara. </p>

<p> "A little. She would hit us on the palm with a ruler."  </p>

<p> "She has a lot of students  though. I still cannot believe that she could
hit you. Did you tell your mother about it?" </p> 

<p> "No. Mothers usually aggravate your problems instead of helping out."</p>

<p> "That might be true" said Tara laughing. </p>

<p> "But I am glad you are my teacher now." </p>

<p> "I am glad you are my student too. But I think you are getting the
good grades on your own. I was trying to find the reason why
you could not get good grades on your own before." </p>

<p> "I think I like it that you think I am good in math. That way I want
to be good in math. I like it when you are amazed that I can solve all
the problems. It gives me confidence and I continue to do better." </p>

<p> "I am sure glad this works for you. You really are a good student.
Now let us be serious and do more math." </p>

<p> Tara and Smita put on a grim face and they both laughed the next minute. </p>

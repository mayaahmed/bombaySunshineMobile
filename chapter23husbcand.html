<h3> Chapter 23  </h3>
<h2>The Husband candidate </h2>

<p> Tara was growing up and she was coming under the radar of suitors
contemplating marriage. It was a nuisance because young men would walk
up to her and talk to her in front of her parents. Her parents were
not pushing her but surely were making room for her to pick one of
the nice young men from their circle. She would invariably wish that
her father would beat up some young man who was bothering her. But one
day the tables were turned. </p>


<p> "One person is coming to see you this Saturday" Tara's father told
her. "See whether you like to marry him."  </p>

<p> "What?!" exclaimed Tara angrily.  "Someone is coming to see me
already. I am not even eighteen yet.  It is not legal to marry me
off."  </p>

<p> "You will be eighteen in six months. The wedding can happen after a
year.  This is once in a lifetime opportunity. This guy is a gem of a
person. He is not greedy. He does not care about dowry. He is handsome
and very educated. He has seen you around and is willing to marry
you."  </p>

<p> "No way. I do not want to marry papa. I do not want to see anybody."   </p>

<p> "Just take a look at him child. You really will like him. I will do
everything only for your good. This person is really a nice guy."   </p>

<p> Tara got angry and said  </p>

<p> "No. I will not see anybody."   </p>

<p> Tara's father started getting angry too.  </p>

<p> "He is coming for lunch anyway."   </p>

<p> "He should not come here for lunch."   </p>

<p> "He will come to lunch as a friend. If he is my friend why can't he
come for lunch?"  </p>

<p> "Just because I will hate him. If you hated somebody will I be able
to bring them home?"   </p>

<p> "You have not met this person. How can you hate him without even seeing
him?"   </p>

<p> "I know I will hate him. What is his name?"  </p>

<p> "Madhav."  </p>

<p> "See. Such a sick name. I knew I would hate him." </p>

<p> "I will not do anything that is not for your good. I am your father
not your enemy." </p>

<p> "Papa, I do not want to marry now. I want to have a career." </p>

<p> "You are not forced to marry him. Just meet him and see what you think." </p>

<p> "No." </p>


<p> Tara's father looked at Tara's mother. Tara's mother just smiled. </p>


<p> "Madhav is coming for lunch on Saturday" Tara's father said. "That is
my final decision.  No more arguments." </p>

 
<p> "What do I care? I am not going to marry him. That is my final decision
too" Tara said. </p>

<p> Her father did not reply. </p>

<p> On Saturday Tara's mother made an elaborate lunch. Tara was generally
angry about the whole procedure. </p>

<p> "Wear something nice" Tara's mother told her. </p>

<p> "Why?" Tara asked. </p>

<p> "Just like that. We are having guests." </p>

<p> "No" Tara replied.</p>

<p> Usually when a husband candidate came to a see a girl, she had to wear
a silk sari and a lot of jewelry and makeup. Tara could sense that her
mother was not completely in agreement with marrying Tara off so
young. Her mother was only going through the procedure half heartedly.
So she did not insist. </p>

<p> "Do what you like" her mother said. </p>

<p> Around noon time Madhav turned up for lunch with his friend. Tara did
not get out of her room and did not help her mother with anything.
She just made a face every time her mother looked at her. Her mother
somehow felt guilty that she was making Tara go through this
experience.  Tara looked so young. But it was tradition. Tara had to
get married some day. And this was a good match. </p>

<p> "Tara, come and have lunch" Tara's father called from the living room. </p>

<p> Tara went into the living room. Her father and brothers were chatting
up Madhav.  Tara had an expression of real anger on her face. She took
some food in her plate and went and sat on the couch.  Her little
brother Chintu did the same and came and sat next to her. </p>

<p> Once or twice when Madhav turned and looked at her, he met with such
angry looks from Tara that he decided to look at her no more. He kept
his eyes turned away from her. </p>

<p> Then Tara slowly became more comfortable. She decided to observe this
husband candidate. Tara had a feeling that this man was not
human. There he was sitting next to her dad talking about god knows
what, may be politics or may be about religion. Tara turned and looked
at Chintu. He was looking at Madhav as though Madhav was some strange
creature. Actually Madhav was a normal person and if Tara had met him
on the road she would have had nothing against him. But he looked so silly
eating lunch and talking politics to her dad and wanting to marry her
that Tara began to find him funny. Tara and Chintu sat and exchanged
looks with suppressed glee at the things that Madhav said. </p>


<p> Madhav avoided looking at Tara completely. He felt a little silly too.
He was cursing himself for having come to this absurd lunch. This was
the first time he had gone to see a prospective bride and it was
nothing like he expected. He did not expect a scowling girl looking at
him as though he was from outer space. He did not know what to do. He
concentrated on the lunch and talked about politics as best as he
could. Tara quickly finished her lunch and left the room. Madhav sat a
little longer and talked about more politics and he left. </p>


<p>  "Such a nice guy. What do you think Tara?" Tara's father asked. </p>

<p>  "He is so terrible. I do not know how anyone will marry him" Tara said. </p>

<p>  Tara's father was a little hurt at what Tara said. </p>

<p> "He can easily find a better bride than you."  </p>

<p>  Tara looked at her father's face. She could not understand his anger. </p>
Was he angry that Tara was being so arrogant and insensitive to
another person's feelings? Or was he angry that Tara rejected his
choice? </p>

<p>  "Do not blame me. I said I did not want to see anybody. Why did you
force me to meet Madhav?" </p>

<p>  "Forget it. You do not know whats good for you" Tara's father said. </p>

<p>  "Madhav is so handsome" Babu said. "He really is a good guy. You
must consider your decision."  </p>

<p>  "Is he handsome? How come I did not find him so?" Tara asked a little
surprised. Did she miss something? Everyone around her was so much in
praise of Madhav. </p>

<p> "He is a good guy. You should marry him" Tara's father continued. </p>

<p> "No" Tara said. </p>

<p> "What do you think of yourself? This is the best possible husband you
could get" Tara's father said. </p>

<p> "I do not want to marry" Tara said. </p>

<p> "Do not bother her" Tara's mother said firmly. That was the final
word.  No one would say anything further. Her mother's word was always
the final word.  </p>

<p> "Thank you mom" said Tara happily.   She gave her mother a hug.  </p> 

<p> "That man was so funny" Chintu said getting a little courage and
finally deciding to give his opinion. Everyone laughed except Tara's
father.  </p>
